## ARM11/ARM9 Registers


Below registers can be accessed by both ARM11 and ARM9. However, most of them
are working best on ARM11 side (because IRQ and DMA startup modes are
implemented on ARM11 side only; and, in some cases, even FIFOs are in a
separate ARM11-only area at 10300000h and up).

One exception is NTRCARD (this does have IRQ/DMA on both ARM9 and ARM11 side).

IO registers starting at physical address 10200000h are not accessible from the
ARM9 (which includes all LCD/GPU registers). It seems IO registers below
physical address 10100000h are not accessible from the ARM11 bus (=trigger data
abort, as so on all unused 1000h-byte areas).


ARM11 kernel virtual address mappings for these registers varies for different
builds. For ARM11 user mode applications you have:

```
  physaddr = virtaddr-1EC00000h+10100000h
```

That is:

```
  Physical   Virtual
  101xxxxxh  1ECxxxxxh
  102xxxxxh  1EDxxxxxh
```

Bit0 must be cleared in GBA mode (where FCRAM is used to emulate the GBA
cartridge ROM), when not clearing bit0, only about 1% of GBA ROM reads will
correctly read from "addr", and the other 99% will accidentally read from
"addr+20h" (wrapped within 800h-byte pages).

## Internal FCRAM Configuration Registers


The 3DS uses the following FCRAM chips:

```
  Old3DS: Fujitsu MB82M8080-07L (128Mbyte)
  New3DS: Fujitsu 82MK9A9A, 7L (256Mbyte)
```

The chip in Old3DS does reportedly internally contain 2 dies:

```
  MB81EDS516545 (4x2Mx64bit, aka 64Mbyte)
  MB82DBS08645 (unknown, supposedly contains the missing 64Mbyte)
```

The MB81EDS516545 datasheet says that there are some internal config registers,
which must be initialized after power up, the initialization requires changing
/RAS and /CAS and some other pins. Unknown if/how the 3DS hardware or software
can/may/must initialize those registers.


```
 ______________________________ SD/MMC Registers ______________________________
```



## SD/MMC Registers


```
  10006000h A9      SD/MMC (for SD/MMC Slot and internal eMMC)
  10006200h A9      mirrors of above (each 200h bytes)
  10007000h A9      SDxx (unused? or maybe SDIO wifi on ARM9 side?)
  10007200h A9      mirrors of above (each 200h bytes)
  10100000h A11/A9  Debug SDIO Regs? (actually just zerofilled?)
  10122000h A11/A9  SDIO WIFI? this is wifi?
  10123000h A11/A9  Reportedly SDIO? (actually just data abort?)
```

These registers are used to access the system NAND and the inserted SD card.
Both devices use the same interface.

HCLK of the SDMMC controller is 67.027964 MHz (double of the DSi HCLK).

Unknown if eMMC and Wifi are fast enough to support HCLK/2 on 3DS.

Standard SD cards may require HCLK/4 on 3DS (unless the card was detected to
support HCLK/2; don't know if it requires further card initialization to enable
fast mode?).

## IRQ\_STAT


```
  3     SD card removal flag     (Set to 1 when SD card is removed)
  4     SD card insertion flag   (Set to 1 when SD card is inserted)
  5     SD card insertion status (0=Missing, 1=Inserted)
```

SD card insertion status

Assertion happens around 250 ms after SD card insertion and/or enabling the
EMMC hardware (delay could possibly be due to an SD bus timeout?).



## Wifi Registers


These registers are used to control the Wifi card via the SDIO protocol.

```

```

The PXI registers are similar to those on DS. Uh, aka what is known as IPC.

But, except, SYNC is 8bit (instead 4bit)!

The FIFO registers seem to be exactly same as on NDS.

```

Caution: The send-value (in bit8-15) is write-only on 3DS (reads as zero), this
is different as on NDS/DSi. As workaround: Use 8bit LDRB/STRB instead of 32bit
LDR/STR when changing the IRQ bits.

## Parody Register summary


After reading through many official datasheets and homebrew wiki pages, some of
the more amazing 3DS hardware related information goes into 1020B000h...

```
  1020B000h 4   Certain Register
  1020B014h 4   Assert Register
  1020B034h 4   This Register
  1020B096h 2   Figure Register
  1020B1BFh 1   Byte Register
  1020B2E4h ??  Broken Register
  1020B3D0h 4   Snakish Register
```



## 1020B000h - Certain Register


This is the Certain register. The register contains certain bits that are used
to enable certain functions, each bit must be set to a certain value. The
entire system will hang if used with a certain setting.



## 1020B014h - Assert Register


Bits in the Assert register get asserted when asserting events are asserted and
de-asserted. You are asserted to assert what the asserted information does
assert. Assert your dictionary if you can't assert that.



## 1020B034h - This Register


This register can be used to change the value of this register by writing to
this register.



## 1020B096h - Figure Register


Figure 128 contains information about the Figure register. These register
specifications are outlined in Figure 128. See Figure 128 for details about the
Figure Register in Figure 128.

Figure 128: Figure 128 is left blank intentionally.


1020B0DCh - ?



## 1020B1BFh - Byte Register


8-bit Byte value 0,1: 1-ish enable 2:31 must be \<this&0x3\<=2'b010 +!
Pdn SoC value>.



## 1020B2E4h - Broken Register


This works exactly as described in the broken link on the hardware page.



## 1020B3D0h - Snakish Register


With Native\_firm as of 8.1.0.192 three additional unsigned flags have been
introduced to the old(6.5.0.0+) specification which did have specific bits at a
certain virtual address and that were not formerly asserted in 1.0.2.30 with
\*ANY\* firm these values must be accumulated with strict binary point
comparisions(in the same format as the other bits) prohibitvely permitting
abstractions of the reorganized architecture in the \*actual\* snakish sentences
used to describe the entire register space(that CAN be changed in future).

Unknown if "Latch" means writing or reading the registers, or if both is
somehow supported.

Unknown why RTC IRQ pin is write-able, maybe ARM11 must manually trigger it?
But if the ALARM registers are write-only then ARM11 couldn't know their
current value (except, by assuming that the written value wasn't changed from
NDS side).

"The hardware key generator is triggered by writing the keyY, which is the only

Whatever, new (unlike DSi).

The Key FIFO's are automatically flushed after each 4 words, and after setting
AES\_KEYCNT.bit7, and reportedly also when changing the AES\_CNT word order.

 __________________________ Notes and DSi Registers __________________________
```



## Notes


When AES\_CNT.bit31 is set, then AES\_CNT essentially becomes locked and doesn't
change when written to. However if AES\_CNT.bit26 is "set", keyslot-selection is
cued to be handled when AES\_CNT.bit31 is cleared.

Clearing AES\_CNT.bit31 while the AES engine is doing crypto will result in the
AES engine stopping crypto, once it finishes processing the current block.



## 10009004h - ARM9 - AES\_MACEXTRABLKCNT


(CCM-MAC extra data length)>>4, ie. the number of block of CCM-MAC extra
data.



## 10009006h - ARM9 - AES\_BLKCNT


(Data length)>>4, ie. the number of blocks to process



## 10009008h - ARM9 - AES\_WRFIFO



## 1000900Ch - ARM9 - AES\_RDFIFO


Reading from AES\_RDFIFO when there's no data available in the RDFIFO will
result in reading the last word that was in the RDFIFO.

When triggering either RDFIFO or WRFIFO to be flushed, the AES Engine does not
clear either buffer.

Word order and endianness can be changed between each read/write to these
FIFOs. However changing the word order when writing to WRFIFO can cause the
word to be written outside the current block, leaving uninitialized data in its
place. Attempts to change endianness or word order are not honored when reading
from RDFIFO when no more data is available.



## 10009020h - ARM9 - AES\_IV (16 bytes)


This register specifies the counter (CTR mode), nonce (CCM mode) or the
initialization vector (CBC mode) depending on the mode of operation. For CBC
and CTR mode this register takes up the full 16 bytes, but for CCM mode the
nonce is only the first 12 bytes. The AES engine will automatically increment
the counter up to the maximum BLKCNT, after which point it must be manually
incremented and set again.



## 10009030h - ARM9 - AES\_MAC (16 bytes)


This register specifies the message authentication code (MAC) for use in CCM
mode.



## 10009040h/10009070h/100090A0h/100090D0h - AES\_KEY0/1/2/3


These registers are the same as they were on TWL, and are likely preserved for
compatibility reasons. The keyslot is updated immediately after \*any\*
data(u8/u32/...) is written here, which was used on DSi to break the
key-generator.



## CCM mode pitfall


Non-standard AES-CCM behaviour is observed on Wrap/Unwrap function. According
to RFC 3610, the first block B\_0 for authentication should be generated from
the message length and some other parameters. Using these function, it seems
that the message length is aligned up to 16 when generating B\_0. This makes the
generated MAC not compliant with the standard when (inputsize-noncesize)%16!=0.
It is very likely that this non-standard behaviour happens on the hardware
level, but not confirmed yet.

```
  uh, or does it just OMIT that, as on DSi?
  instead of that "aligned" thing?
```

## 1000A000h/10101000h - SHA\_CNT - SHA Control (R/W)


```

```

The optional readback mode allows to readback each 40h-byte block from the
FIFO, this can reduce memory reads (and temporary memory writes), for example:

```
  EMMC --> SHA --> AES --> Memory        ;saves 1xMemWrite and 2xMemRead
  EMMC --> AES --> SHA --> Memory        ;saves 1xMemRead
```

The SHA\_IN writing speed is about 62Mbyte/s for SHA256 and SHA224, and
50Mbyte/s for SHA1. Reading source data, and optional forwarding to SHA\_OUT may
cause extra slowdown.



## 1000A004h/10101004h - SHA\_BLKCNT - SHA Input Length (R/W)


```
  0-31  Length in bytes (0..FFFFFFFFh)
```

The length is automatically updated by hardware:

```
  Length is reset to zero when setting SHA_CNT.bit0 (start).
  Length increments by 40h after each 40h-byte FIFO block.
  Length increments by remaining FIFO size after setting SHA_CNT.bit1 (final).
```

The hardware does automatically append the length value (and some padding bits)
to the data stream before computing the final result.



## 1000A040h/10101040h - SHA\_HASH - State/Result (20h bytes) (R/W)


Contains the SHA state/result. The word order is fixed, the byte order (per
32bit word) depends on SHA\_CNT.bit3.

Setting SHA\_CNT.bit0 does automatically apply the following initial values:

- SHA256 6A09E667,BB67AE85,3C6EF372,A54FF53A,510E527F,9B05688C,1F83D9AB,5BE0CD19
- SHA224 C1059ED8,367CD507,3070DD17,F70E5939,FFC00B31,68581511,64F98FA7,BEFA4FA4
- SHA1   67452301,EFCDAB89,98BADCFE,10325476,C3D2E1F0,0       ,0       ,0

The values are updated after each 40h-byte FIFO block, and updated once more
after final round.

SHA1 leaves the last 3 words unused (set to zero). SHA224 and SHA256 do
internally use all 8 words (but the last word is usually omitted when reading
the SHA224 result).



## 1000A080h/10301000h - SHA\_FIFO (40h bytes) - SHA\_IN (W) and SHA\_OUT (R)


```
  0-7   1st byte        ;\
  8-15  2nd byte        ; data to be checksummed
  16-23 3rd byte        ;
  24-31 4th byte        ;/
```

The FIFO is mapped to a 40h-byte area at FIFO+0..3Fh. The word address is don't
care (one can write all words to FIFO+0, or to FIFO+0,4,8,..,3Ch).

However, 8bit/16bit writes do REQUIRE the lower two addresss bits to match up
with the number of previously written bytes (eg. byte writes must go to
FIFO+0,1,2,3,4,5,..,3Fh or FIFO+0,1,2,3,0,1,.,3). Writing 8bit/16bit is
normally needed only for the last block before setting final flag (and only if
the length isn't a multiple of 40h). Writing 8bit/16bit may be also needed if
the data comes from an odd source address (but that would slowdown everything).



## Invalid Operations with/without Data Abort


```
  Reading FIFO when CNT.bit8=0 returns ZERO (readback disabled)
  Reading FIFO when CNT.bit8=1 and FIFO empty causes Data Abort (enabled+empty)
```

Untested...

```
  Writing FIFO when FIFO full... is ignored? or data abort?
  Writing 32bit to FIFO content is odd (not N*4 bytes)... causes what?
  Writing 32bit to FIFO already contains 3Dh..3Fh bytes... causes what?

## 1000B0F0h - ARM9 - RSA\_UNKNOWN (R and/or W)


```
  0-28  Unknown/unused?   (always zero)
  29    Unknown/readonly? (always set)
  30-31 Unknown/unused?   (always zero)
```

The bootroms writes zero in RSA IRQ init, so some bits might be write-only?
Writing seems to have no effect on anything though.



## 1000B100h+(0..3)\*10h - ARM9 - RSA\_SLOTCNT\_0..3 (R/W)


```
  0     Read: Exponent Status (0=Bad=LessThan4orOdd, 1=Good=4orMoreAndEven) (R)
        Write: Clear RSA_SLOTSIZE/EXPFIFO (0=Clear, 1=No Change)            (W)
  1     Disable RSA_EXPFIFO Writes        (0=Normal, 1=DataAbort)         (R/W)
  2     Disable RSA_MOD Reads             (0=Normal, 1=DataAbort)         (R/W)
  3-30  Unused (0)
  31    Disable RSA_SLOTCNT_x Writes      (0=Normal, 1=Disable/permanent) (R/w)
```

Bit1,2 can be changed only if Status Bit0 was set (Good=4orMoreAndEven).



## 1000B104h+(0..3)\*10h - ARM9 - RSA\_SLOTSIZE\_0..3 (R)


```
  0-31  Number of words written to EXPFIFO (range 0..40h)
```

Indicates the EXP size (and implied: the MOD and DATA sizes). Whilst that
number is important, programmers should usually know how many words they had
used, without needing to use the SLOTSIZE register.



## 1000B200h - ARM9 - RSA\_EXPFIFO - Exponent; usually 10001h, or Private Key (W)



## 1000B204h..1000B2FFh - ARM9 - RSA\_EXPFIFO mirrors (W)


```
  0-31  FIFO, in current byte-order, to be written MSW first (max 40h words)
```

The number of words written to EXPFIFO does imply the size of the MOD and DATA
values (that makes sense for private exponents, but the public exponent 10001h
must be padded with leading zeroes, and then followed by 10001h in last word
(aka 01000100h for big-endian).

The RSA hardware wants the number of words to be an even number in range of
4..40h, aka a multiple of 8 bytes in range 10h..100h (and if so, sets
SLOTCNT.bit0).



## 1000B400h..1000B4FFh - ARM9 - RSA\_MOD - Modulus; Public Key (R/W)


```
  100h-byte area, in currently selected byte/word-order, for current keyslot
```

The upper bits are unused/don't care when SLOTSIZE\<40h.



## 1000B800h..1000B8FFh - ARM9 - RSA\_DATA (100h bytes) (R/W)


```
  100h-byte area, in currently selected byte/word-order
```

Contains the data that is to be encrypted/decrypted, and contains the result
after completion.

The upper bits are unused/don't care when SLOTSIZE\<40h.



## RSA Timing Examples (versus 67MHz timer)


```
  0.9ms (E475h clks)   Public key, 80h-bytes (DSi-style)
  3.3ms (3571Dh clks)  Public key, 80h-bytes zeropadded to 100h-bytes size
  3.3ms (3574Ah clks)  Public key, 100h-bytes (3DS-style)
  200ms (CE59A5h clks) Private key, 100h-bytes (3DS-style)
```



## Invalid Operations with/without Data Abort


```
  Reading MOD or DATA when busy (and maybe also on writing?)  --> Data Abort
  Reading MOD when disabled in SLOTCNT                        --> Data Abort
  Writing EXPFIFO when disabled in SLOTCNT                    --> Data Abort
  Writing more than 40h words to EXPFIFO                      --> Data Abort
  Reading EXPFIFO or reading unused registers like 1000B5xxh  --> Returns Zero
```



## Keyslot 0..3 usage


During boot, the bootrom uses the following PUBLIC keys (100h byte modulus,
with exponent 10001h):

```
  Slot 0 uninitialized                     (unused)
  Slot 1 retail=FFFFB1E0h, debug=FFFFC4E0h (for FIRM from eMMC)
  Slot 2 retail=FFFFB2E0h, debug=FFFFC5E0h (for FIRM from Wifi-Flash/NDS-Cart)
  Slot 3 retail=FFFFB0E0h, debug=FFFFC3E0h (for NCSD from eMMC)
```

After boot, the bootrom does replace the above keys by four PRIVATE keys (with
100h byte modulus, and 100h byte exponent):

```
  Slot 0 retail=FFFFB3E0h, debug=FFFFC6E0h ;\Hardware slots (modulus+exponent)
  Slot 1 retail=FFFFB5E0h, debug=FFFFC8E0h ; (the modulus are also stored in
  Slot 2 retail=FFFFB7E0h, debug=FFFFCAE0h ; RAM at ITCM+3D00h+(0..3)*100h)
  Slot 3 retail=FFFFB9E0h, debug=FFFFCCE0h ;/
  Slot 4 retail=FFFFBBE0h, debug=FFFFCEE0h ;\
  Slot 5 retail=FFFFBDE0h, debug=FFFFD0E0h ; RAM slots (modulus+exponent are
  Slot 6 retail=FFFFBFE0h, debug=FFFFD2E0h ; stored at ITCM+4100h+(0..3)*200h)
  Slot 7 retail=FFFFC1E0h, debug=FFFFD4E0h ;/
```

Later on, the firmware does replace some slots by other keys:

```
  Slot 0 Arbitrary (uh?)
  Slot 1 CXI access desc (following the exheader, uh?)
  Slot 2 Unused (contains the private key from bootrom)
  Slot 3 Unused (contains the private key from bootrom)
```



## RSA Basics and Differences to DSi


The 3DS RSA hardware is more or less same as the DSi RSA BIOS functions, see
there for general info about RSA maths and RSA padding:

- [BIOS RSA Functions (DSi only)](#biosrsafunctionsdsionly)
Apart from being hardware-implemented, the 3DS is usually using 100h-bytes
(instead 80h), with SHA256 signatures (instead SHA1), and with OpenPGP headers
(instead raw padding).



## Blurb


Writing to RSA\_MOD does not change the exponent written with RSA\_EXPFIFO. An
attack based on the Pohlig-Hellman algorithm exists to "read" the contents of
RSA\_EXPFIFO as a result (see 3DS System Flaws).



## RSA Overview


The RSA module is essentially a hardware-accelerated modular exponentiation
engine. It is specially optimized for RSA applications, so its behavior can be
incoherent when RSA's invariants are broken.

The PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography Standards) message padding must be manually
checked by software, as hardware will only do raw RSA operations.



## Observed edge cases


```
  "if 2 divides mod, output == 0"
```

uh, how to "divide" a "mod" ?

uh, for mod2, remainder SHOULD be 0 or 1 (or is it ALWAYS 0 here?)

uh, also, MOD may be required to be bigger than DATA?

## OTP Registers


```
  10012000h 100h  Encrypted 3DS OTP  (R)
  10012100h 8     DSi OTP Console ID (R/W?)
```

Access to this region is disabled once the ARM9 writes 02h to CFG9\_SYSPROT9.



## 10012000h - 100h bytes - Encrypted 3DS OTP (R)


Console-unique data encrypted with AES-CBC. The normalkey and IV are stored in
Boot9 (retail/devunit have seperate normalkey+IV for this).



## 10012100h - 8 bytes - DSi OTP Console ID (R/W?)


Before writing CFG9\_SYSPROT9 bit1, the ARM9 copies the 8-byte TWL Console ID
here. This sets the registers at 4004D00h for ARM7.

```
  [10012100h] = DecryptedOTP[008h] xor B358A6AFh or 80000000h
  [10012104h] = DecryptedOTP[00Ch] xor 08C267B7h
```



## Decrypted OTP


```
  000h 90h   Copied into ITCM. The encrypted version of this is what
                New3DS-arm9loader hashes for key-generation.
  000h 4     Always DEADB00Fh
  004h 4     DeviceId (aka Console ID, used in tickets)
  008h 10h   Fall-back keyY used for movable.sed keyY when
                movable.sed doesn't exist in NAND (the last(???) two words
                here are used on retail for generating console-unique TWL
                keydata/etc).
                This is also used for "LocalFriendCodeSeed", etc.
  018h 1     CTCert byte order? (usually 05h)
  019h 1     CTCert issuer type:
               zero = retail  ("Nintendo CA - G3_NintendoCTR2prod")
               non-zero = dev ("Nintendo CA - G3_NintendoCTR2dev")
  01Ah 6     Manufacturing date (year-1900, month, day, hour, minute, second)
  020h 4     CTCert ECDSA exponent (byte-swapped when OTP[018h]>=5)
  024h 2     Zero?
  026h 1Eh   CTCert ECDSA private key
  044h 3Ch   CTCert ECDSA signature

  0E0h 20h   SHA256 hash across [000h..0DFh]
```



## OTP Blurp


After decryption, the first 90h-bytes of plaintext are copied to ITCM+3800h at
01FFB800h aka 07FFB800h if hash verification passes.


On FIRM versions prior to 3.0.0-X, this region was left unprotected. On
versions since 3.0.0-X, this has been fixed, and the region disable is now done
by Kernel9 after doing console-unique TWL keyinit, by setting bit1 of
CFG9\_SYSPROT9. However, with the New3DS FIRM ARM9 binary this is now done in
the FIRM ARM9 binary loader, which also uses the 10012000h region for New 3DS
key generation.


On development units (UNITINFO != 0) ARM9 uses the first 8-bytes from 10012000h
for the TWL Console ID. This region doesn't seem to be used by NATIVE\_FIRM on
retail at all, besides New3DS key-generation in the ARM9-loader.

## Random notes


After writing to a keyslot, the keyslot must be selected again (write
AES\_KEYSEL + set AES\_CNT bit26), even when writing to the same keyslot. Writing
the last word to a key FIFO immediately after selecting a keyslot will not
affect the keyslot keydata that gets used at that time, the new keydata will
not get used until the keyslot gets selected again.


Writing to the key FIFOs with byte writes results in the AES engine converting
the byte to a word (word=byte\*01010101h). The result is the same regardless of
which FIFO register byte was written to.


The key FIFOs can be written simultaneously. For example, executing the
following will result in the keyX and keyY being set to all-zero (unknown for
normalkey): memset(0x10009100, 0, 0x100); uh, does that mean there are mirrors
at 1000910Ch and up?


Each key FIFO has a 10h-byte tmp-buffer for storing the words written to that
FIFO. Once the last word is written to a key FIFO, the filled tmp-buffer is
then written to the key-data for the keyslot selected by AES\_KEYCNT at the time
the last word was written.



## FIRM-launch key clearing


Starting with 9.0.0-20 the Process9 FIRM-launch code now "clears" the following
AES keyslots, with certain keydata by writing the normal-key: 0x15 and
0x18-0x20. These are the keyslots used by the New3DS FIRM arm9bin loader (minus
keyslot 0x11), the New3DS Process9 does this too.

# <a name="3dscryptorsasighax"></a>3DS Crypto - RSA sighax



sighax is a set of fake RSA signatures which are causing the bootrom to always
pass RSA checks.



## How it works


derrek's sighax relies on some bugs in the bootrom RSA signature verification.
RSA doesn't throw errors when decrypting a wrong signature with wrong key
(instead, it does just output "random" gibberish). The decrypted signature
should normally consist of leading FFh-padding bytes, a header, and a SHA
checksum.

However, the 3DS bootrom doesn't insist on the padding bytes, and it does
ignore most of the header bytes. Finally, it does allow the header size to be
as large as occupying the whole 100h-byte signature area, which results in the
SHA value being read from next higher address AFTER the signature area - and
the bootrom happens to store the computed SHA at that location (causing the
bootrom to compare the computed SHA against itself, instead of against of what
should have been the decrypted SHA value).

Alltogether, brute-forcing requires only 6 specific bytes in the decrypted
signature (and the remaining 250 bytes are don't care).


The bootrom uses three RSA keys for different retail signatures, and another
three RSA keys for debug version.



## NCSD Signature (in eMMC)


The eMMC's NCSD Header is unencrypted, and can be changed without needing any
AES keys (however, booting custom code requires to change FIRM, not NCSD).

```



## FIRM Signature (in eMMC)


The eMMC's FIRM Header is encrypted via console-specific AES keys. Patching
this area requires access to the corresponding AES keyslot (or knowing the OTP
seed value that was used to generate that key). Alternately, knowing the
decrypted content of the currently installed firmware version will also help
(then one can simply XOR the encrypted bytes by old & new unencrypted
bytes).

## FIRM Signature (in WifiFlash or NtrCard)


These FIRM Headers are encrypted via fixed AES keys, and can be thus generated
without knowing console-specific keys. However, there are some hardware
requirements:

WifiFlash must have the write-protect pin disabled, and offset 400h must be
writeable (this does require a SPI flash chip with 128Kbyte or more; and won't
work with the normal built-in 4Kbyte chip). And, the eMMC firm sections must be
'destroyed' to trigger WifiFlash booting.

NtrCard requires a NDS flashcart, and support for rewriting its "bootmenu"
memory region. And, key combination Start+Select+X with shell closed is needed
to trigger NtrCard booting.

And with new bit in NDMAGCNT register:

And with new bits in NDMAxCNT registers:

```

Obviously still missing is MIC microphone (which should be supported by either
NDMA, XDMA, or CDMA) (but maybe needs to be enabled somewhere, maybe selecting
ARM/TEAK as target?).

Also nice would be having SDIO-Wifi on ARM9 side somewhere. Old NDS-Wifi might
exist somewhere, too?

New3DS can use both Old CDMA and NewDMA, however, the peripheral data requests
are sent only to either one (as selected in Port 10140410h).

Apart from peripherals, concerning ROM/RAM memory:

- CDMA can probably access whatever ARM11 memory (maybe whatever or so?)

- CDMA might maybe use Virtual memory addresses instead of physical addresses?

Apart from peripherals, concerning ROM/RAM memory:

- XDMA can access ARM9 memory (probably Main RAM, and AXI, and maybe others?)

- XDMA reportedly cannot access the ARM9 bootrom at all

## Corelink DMA Engines


```
  1000C000h ARM9  XDMA CoreLink DMA-330 r0p0 (four channels)
  10200000h ARM11 CDMA CoreLink DMA-330 r0p0 (eight channels)
  10206000h ARM11 CDMA CoreLink DMA-330 r1p1 (eight channels) (New3DS only)
  10300000h ARM11 DMA region (aka FIFOs are here?)
```

The New3DS has two DMA controllers on ARM11 side (the r0p0 is used by bootrom,
and, after bootrom, everything is usually done by r1p1).

Bit [N] = 0 If the DMAC executes DMASEV for the event-interrupt resource N then
the DMAC signals event N to all of the threads. Set bit [N] to 0 if your system
design does not use irq[N] to signal an interrupt request.

Bit [N] = 1 If the DMAC executes DMASEV for the event-interrupt resource N then
the DMAC sets irq[N] HIGH. Set bit [N] to 1 if your system design requires
irq[N] to signal an interrupt request.

Note: See DMASEV on page 4-14 for information about selecting an event number.

## 10000000h - CFG9\_SYSPROT9


```
  0     Disables ARM9 bootrom "(+8000h)" when set to 1, and enables access to
          FCRAM. Cannot be cleared to 0 once set to 1.  Boot9
  1     Disables OTP area when set to 1. Cannot be cleared to 0 once set to 1.
          NewKernel9Loader, Process9
  2-7   Unused (0)
```


On Old 3DS, NATIVE\_FIRM reads CFG9\_SYSPROT9 to know whether it has previously
initialized the TWL console-unique keys using the OTP data. After setting the
TWL console-unique keys, NATIVE\_FIRM sets CFG9\_SYSPROT9 bit 1 to disable the
OTP area. In subsequent FIRM launches prior to the next reset, NATIVE\_FIRM will
see that the OTP area is disabled, and skip this step.


On New 3DS, the above is instead done by the Kernel9 loader. In addition to
using the OTP data for initializing the TWL console-unique keys, the Kernel9
loader will generate the decryption key for NATIVE\_FIRM. The final keyslot for
NATIVE\_FIRM is preserved, so that at a non-reset FIRM launch, the keyslot can
be reused, since the OTP would then be inaccessible.



## 10000001h - CFG9\_SYSPROT11


```
  0     Disables ARM11 bootrom "(+8000h)" when set to 1, and enables access
          to FCRAM. Cannot be cleared to 0 once set to 1.  Boot9
  1-7   Unused (0)
```



## 10000002h - CFG9\_RST11


```
  0     Presumably takes ARM11 out of reset. Cannot be set to 1 once it has
          been cleared.
        Reportedly: Bit0 is actually for "write-protecting the bootrom area"

  0-31  Whatever, debug related (readonly, always zero on retail consoles)
```



## 10000008h - CFG9\_AES (R/W)


```
  0-1   Unknown (R/W)
  2-3   AES related? Value 3 written after write to AES_CTL (R/W)
  4-7   Unused (0)
```



## 1000000Ch - CFG9\_CARD\_CTL - Gamecard Controller Select (R/W)


```
  0-1   Gamecard ROM controller  (0=NTRCARD, 1=?, 2=CTRCARD0, 3=CTRCARD1)
  2-3   Unused (0)
  4     Gamecard SPI_CARD mode   (0=Manual, 1=FIFO)

  9-11  Unused (0)
  12    Unknown...? (R/W)
  13-15 Unused (0)
```

There are three controllers for ROM cartridge commands:

```
  xxx0h/xxx1h? NTRCARD  (8-byte commands)  (bit1=0)         (Port 10164000h)
  xxx2h        CTRCARD0 (16-byte commands) (bit1=1, bit0=0) (Port 10004000h)
  xxx3h        CTRCARD1 (16-byte commands) (bit1=1, bit0=1) (Port 10005000h)
```

And three controllers for SPI-bus cartridge savedata:

```
  x0x0h/x0x1h  NTRCARD Manual NDS-style    (bit8=0, bit1=0) (Port 10164000h)
  x0x2h/x0x3h  None                        (bit8=0, bit1=1) (N/A)
  x10xh        SPI_CARD in Manual Mode     (bit8=1, bit4=0) (Port 1000D000h)
  x11xh        SPI_CARD in FIFO Mode       (bit8=1, bit4=1) (Port 1000D800h)
```

The deselected controllers are disconnected from the cartridge bus (and tend to
return data=FFh when trying to read from the cartridge).



## 10000010h - CFG9\_CARD\_POWER (same as SCFG\_MC on DSi) (R/W)


```
  0     NDS Slot Game Cartridge (0=Inserted, 1=Ejected)               (R)

```

Same as SCFG\_MC on DSi (but with the bits for 2nd cartridge slot removed). See
DSi specs for cartridge power on/off sequences.

## 10000012h - CFG9\_CARD\_INSERT\_DELAY (usually 1988h = 100ms) (R/W)



## 10000014h - CFG9\_CARD\_PWROFF\_DELAY (usually 264Ch = 150ms) (R/W)


Same as 4004012h/4004014h on DSi, see DSi SCFG registers for details.

There are related IRQs on ARM9 and ARM11 side (CGC aka Change Gamecard or so):

```
  ARM9 IF.bit25, and ARM11 Interrupt 74h   ;at begin of PWROFF delay
  ARM9 IF.bit26, and ARM11 Interrupt 75h   ;at end of INSERT delay
```



## 10000020h - CFG9\_SDMMCCTL


Controls power? Also controls SD card detect?

```
  0     SD slot power                                 (1=Unknown?) Process9
  1     eMMC power? NAND init hangs if set            (1=Set?)     Process9
  2-3   Other power supplies?                         (??)         Process9

  6     Unknown, set at cold boot                     (1=Set?)     R/W
  7     Unknown                                       (?)          R/W
  8     ? This bit seems to do nothing.               (?)          Process9
  9     If not set force pulls all SD card lines high (0=Not set?) Process9
  10-15 Unused (0)
```

This register controls power of multiple ports/controllers and allows to map
controller 3 to ARM9 or ARM11. The SD card can be accessed on ARM11 by setting
bit8 and clearing bit9.

```
  0     Controller 1/3 port 0 power (SD card) (0=On, 1=Off)  ;10xxx000h.port0
  1     Controller 1 port 1 power (eMMC)      (0=On, 1=Off)  ;10006000h.port1

  3     Unknown (R/W)
  4-7   Unused (0)
  8-13  Unknown (R/W)
  14-15 Unused (0)

## 10000200h - New3DS - CFG9\_EXTMEMCNT9


```
  0     New3DS: Extended ARM9 memory at 08100000h..0817FFFFh (0=Off, 1=On)
  1-31  Unused (0)
```



## 10000FFCh - CFG9\_MPCORECFG (R)


Identical to "PDN\_MPCORE\_CFG". Uh, what?

Above seems to refer to one of the "CONFIG11" registers.

Perhaps 10140FFCh - 16bit CFG11\_SOCINFO, though the ARM9 register is 32bit?

Or maybe one of the CFG11\_MPCORE\_xxx registers, though those are New3DS only?

Or maybe it does actually refer to ARM11 cp15 coprocessor registers???

Or maybe one of the MPCore registers at 17E0xxxxh?

PROBABLY it's CFG11\_SOCINFO (as they are both read-only 0007h on New3DS)!



## 10010000h - CFG9\_BOOTENV


```
  0-31  Value (0..FFFFFFFFh) (R/W)
```

This register is used to determine what the previous running FIRM was. Its
value is kept following an MCU reboot. Its initial value (on a cold boot) is 0.
NATIVE\_FIRM sets it to 1 on shutdown/FIRM launch.

```
  LGY FIRM writes value 3 here when launching a TWL title
  LGY FIRM writes value 7 when launching an AGB title
```

NATIVE\_FIRM will only launch titles if this is not value 0, and will only save
the AGB\_FIRM savegame to SD if this is value 7.



## 10010010h - CFG9\_UNITINFO (R)


This 8bit register is value zero for retail, non-zero for dev/debug units.



## 10010014h - CFG9\_TWLUNITINFO (R/W)


```
  0-1   Value (to be copied from CFG9_UNITINFO)
  2-7   Unused (0)
```

In the console-unique TWL key-init/etc function the ARM9 copies the u8 value
from REG\_UNITINFO to this register.

Note: TSC triggers on headphone connect, ack by reading TSC[67h:2Bh].

The REASON bits are getting set only if enabled in CFG11\_PDN\_WAKE\_ENABLE (and
only if the corresponding bits in GPIO\_DATA1\_IRQ\_ENABLE, GPIO\_DATA3\_IRQ\_ENABLE,
and HID\_PAD\_IRQ are also enabled).

The REASON bits can be cleared by writing 1 (unless the request condition is
still enabled and true).

Caution: Nonzero REASON bits can cause attempts to switch to New3DS mode (via
CFG11\_MPCORE\_CLKCNT) to hang?

Caution: Above is for New3DS (Old3DS doesn't have NFC and C-stick, and the
other bits are probably all completely different and still unknown).

Allows to trigger an IRQ when ARM7 enters lower power sleep mode (via GBA SWI
03h or NDS7/DSi7 SWI 07h). If so, one should forward the ARM7 wakeup condition
from CFG11\_TWLMODE\_HID\_IRQ to ARM11 register HID\_PAD\_IRQ, enter sleep mode on
ARM11 side, and (after ARM11 wakeup) wakeup ARM7 via CFG11\_TWLMODE\_SLEEP.bit0.

This is a readonly mirror of the ARM7 Key Interrupt Control register (KEYCNT,
GBA/NDS Port 4000132h). The ARM7 uses this as wakeup condition for sleep mode,
the ARM11 could forward that value to HID\_PAD\_IRQ when entering sleep mode,
too. In homebrew code, one can also mis-use the register to send data from ARM7
to ARM11.

Note: The NDS does also have a separate KEYCNT register on ARM9, but that isn't
forwarded to ARM11 side.

Set bits will use the corresponding values from CFG11\_TWLMODE\_HID\_SET instead
of allowing the hardware to read it from HID\_PAD.

This is set to 0x1FFF (all buttons and the debug key) and CFG11\_TWLMODE\_HID\_SET
is set to 0 when the "Close this software and return to HOME Menu?" dialog is
shown to prevent the button presses from propagating to the DS/GBA CPU.

After toggling bit0 from 0-to-1, one must wait until the apply has finished.

working apply sequences:

```

  Write 0h, Write 1h, Wait until Bit2=0           ;good, for GBA mode only
  Write 0h, Write 3h, do ugly hardcoded delay     ;ugly, for GBA and 3DS mode

busy (or if GBA mode is active).

Unknown what bit0-1 do exactly, maybe one is reset, and one is stop (they must
be BOTH set though, otherwise registers at 10203000h are always zero).

  19-31  Unused (0)
```

Mode values:

```
  Mode 0: Old3DS Mode, 268MHz (1x), 128MB FCRAM, no L2C cache
  Mode 1: New3DS Mode, 268MHz (1x), 256MB FCRAM, and L2C cache controller
  Mode 3: New3DS Mode, 536MHz (2x), 256MB FCRAM, and L2C cache controller
  Mode 5: New3DS Mode, 804MHz (3x), 256MB FCRAM, and L2C cache controller
  Mode 2/4/6 are same as Mode 0. Mode 7 is same as Mode 5
```

Mode changes are applied ONLY once when all ARM11 cores are in Wait for IRQ
state (eg. "WFI" opcode). At that point, the IRQ flag in bit15 is set, and IRQ
58h is triggered.

Mode changes (and IRQs) occur ONLY when changing to different modes:

```
  - Changing between mode 0/1/3/5/7 (because they are different)
  - Changing between mode 5/7 (although they appear to be same)
```

Mode changes (and IRQs) do NOT occur when:

```
  - Rewriting the current mode value (because mode is already same)
  - Changing between mode 0/2/4/6 (because they are all same as mode 0)
```

New3DS mode enables some registers (eg. 10141240h, which are always zero in
Old3DS mode), and unlocks some Memory and I/O regions (which trigger data abort
in Old3DS mode):

```
  10130000h (L2B_0, L2B_1, Y2R_1, and MVD registers)
  10206000h (newer CDMA controller)
  17E10000h (L2C cache controller)
  28000000h (Extra FCRAM)
```

Other New3DS memory isn't automatically enabled (and keeps triggering data
abort even in New3DS mode, until explicitely enabling it):

```
  08100000h (Extended ARM9 RAM, needs enable via CFG9_EXTMEMCNT9.bit0)
  1F000000h (New VRAM aka QTM, needs enable via CFG11_MPCORE_CNT.bit0)
```

Clock changes affect the ARM11 CPU clock, including the MPCore Timer/Watchdog
registers at 17E00600h (if desired, one can change their prescalers to maintain
them running at same speed despite of the higher CPU clock).

The 804MHz mode should be used only if CFG11\_SOCINFO.bit2 indicates that it is
supported.

The IRQ flag in bit15 should be acknowledge before (or alongsides with) writing
the desired clock value (needed if it was still set from an older
un-acknowledged clock change).

IRQ 58h should be enabled to recover from WFI (or maybe anything like Hblank
IRQ might work for that, too). CPSR.I flag does not need to be enabled, WFI
does only wait for IRQs (but can recover without executing them). Using the old
CP15 Wait-for-IRQ opcode instead of WFI does work, too.

These are readonly dummy registers, somewhat indicating that CPU0/1 do exist
and that they were already started (of which, CPU0 is actually running code,
and CPU1 is initially hanging in a bootrom waitloop; which waits for FIRM code
to send software interrupt 01h via Port 17E01F00h, and then jumps to
[1FFFFFDCh]).



## 10141312h - New3DS - CFG11\_MPCORE\_BOOTCNT\_CPU2 (R/W)

  6-7   Unused (0)
```

Starting CPU2/3 must be done with CFG11\_BOOTROM\_OVERLAY\_CNT/VAL (the default
reset vector in ARM11 bootrom doesn't support booting CPU2/3).

Bit0 enables CPU2/3 (and alongsides enables corresponding registers at
17E00900h/17E00A00h).

Bit1 must be set alongsides with bit0 (otherwise the CPU hangs somehow), once
when the CPU is started, toggling bit1 won't affect the CPU operation; clearing
bit1 is commonly done to notify CPU0 that the CPU has started.

Note: When starting/stopping CPU2/3, one should also notify the hardware about
the new state (via Port 17E00008h, SCU CPU Status Register).




# <a name="3dsconfigaxiregisters"></a>3DS Config - AXI Registers




## PrimeCell High-Performance AXI Bus Matrix (HPM) (PL301) Revision: r1p2


This is something for configuring interactions between Master Interfaces (MIs)
and Slave Interfaces (SIs). The datasheet contains only meaningless blurb in a
too-big-too-fail language. Guessing between the lines, Master does probably
refer to CPUs and DMA controllers, and Slave might refer to Memory Chips.

These registers allow to read some fixed settings, and to change a few variable
settings (there must be a lot more fixed internal settings assigned at
manufacturing time, but one cannot read or change them).

The 3DS seems to support 1020F400h/1020F404h for Master 0 only.

Whilst 1020F408h/1020F40Ch are supported for Master 0 and up.

than means).

## 1020F408h+MI\*20h AR Channel Arbitration value for MI=00h..NumMI-1 (R/W)



## 1020F40Ch+MI\*20h AW Channel Arbitration value for MI=00h..NumMI-1 (R/W)


Arbitration for AXI read (AR) and AXI write (AW) address channel signals.

The meaning of these register depends on the chip-configuration. There are
three possible modes for each MI (of which, the 3DS uses LRG for MI=00h, and
Fixed RR for MI=01h and up).

- Programmable Least Recently Granted (LRG) arbitration (3DS: used for MI=00h)
  - Write ii00pp00h   ;set priority for interface                         ;-write
  - Write FF0000iih   ;select interface for reading                       ;\read
  - Read  0000ppiih   ;read priority for previously selected interface    ;/
- Fixed Round-robin (RR) arbitration scheme (3DS: used for MI=01h..NumMI-1)
  - Write xxxxxxxxh   ;ignored (values are fixed)                         ;-write
  - Write FF0000ssh   ;select slot for reading                            ;\read
  - Read  000000iih   ;read interface for previously selected slot        ;/
- Programmable Round-robin (RR) arbitration scheme (3DS: not used)
  - Write ss0000iih   ;set interface for slot                             ;-write
  - Write FF0000ssh   ;select slot for reading                            ;\read
  - Read  000000iih   ;read interface for previously selected slot        ;/

Whereas, the parameter bits are:

```
  pp = Priority               (00h..FFh; 00h=Highest, FFh=Lowest)  ;for LRG
  ss = Slot number            (00h..unknown max value)             ;for RR
  ii = Slave interface number (00h..NumSI-1)
  FF = Fixed code for reading (FFh)
  00 = Unused/reserved        (00h)
```

The following settings exist on New3DS (the fixed values are same for AR+AW):

```
  Master  Old3DS Mode                        New3DS Mode
  MI=00h  pp pp pp pp pp pp pp -- -- -- --   pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp pp --

  MI=15h  -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   -- 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 --
```

Entries with value "01..09" are fixed (and have same values for AR and AW).

Entries marked "--" are reading as zero (but there seems to be no way to
distinguish between SI=00h and SI=None).

The priority values (pp) for MI=00h are ininitally 00h, but can be changed,
New3DS has 34 priority values in total (7+7 for AR+AW in Old3DS mode, and
another 10+10 for AR+AW in New3DS mode).



## 1020FFC0h PrimeCell Configuration Register 0 Num SIs (R)

```
  0-7   Number of Master/Slave Interfaces (MIs/SIs) (01h..20h)

```

The values here change depending on whether running in Old3DS or New3DS mode.

```
  Old3DS Mode: NumMI=11h, NumSI=07h
  New3DS Mode: NumMI=16h, NumSI=0Ah
```



## 1020FFC8h PrimeCell Configuration Register 2 Zero (R)



## 1020FFCCh PrimeCell Configuration Register 3 Zero (R)


```
  0-31  Zero
```



## 1020FFE0h-FECh - PrimeCell Peripheral Register 0-3 (R)


This region contains four 32bit registers (01h,13h,x4h,00h). One is supposed to
extract the lower 8bit of these 32bit values, and then to merge them into a
"conceptual-32bit-value" (00x41301h). And then interprete it as so:

```
  0-11  Part number            (301h=HPM)
  12-19 Designer               (41h=ARM)
  20-23 Revision               (1=r1p0, 2=r1p1, 3=r1p2)
  24-31 Reserved (undef)
```

This value is fixed=00341301h on New3DS (ie. r1p2, no matter if running in
Old3DS or New3DS mode).

The value on actual Old3DS is unknown (although, some consoles are reportedly
using r1p0?).



## 1020FFF0h-FFCh - PrimeCell ID Register 0-3 (R)


This region contains four 32bit registers (0Dh,F0h,05h,B1h). One is supposed to
extract the lower 8bit of these 32bit values, and then to merge them into a
"conceptual-32bit-value" (B105F00Dh). And then interprete it as so:

```
  0-31  Component ID (B105F00Dh) (same ID as for Corelink DMA controller)
```

Caution: L2C registers can be read via LDR only (LDRB/LDRH cause data abort).

Note: Some L2C registers are write-able only with Secure access (S), not with
Non-secure access (NS), but that seems to apply only for TrustZone extension
(which doesn't seem to exist in 3DS).

For specs on GBA/NDS/DSi mode:

- [GBA Reference](gba.html#gbareference)
- [NDS Reference](#ndsreference)
- [DSi Reference](ds.html#dsireference)
The ARM7\_RTC\_xxx registers are emulating the GBA cartridge RTC. The RTC for
NDS/DSi mode is emulated separately via registers in the 3DS GPIO register
space:

- [3DS GPIO Registers](#3dsgpioregisters)
The GBA/NDS/DSi video must be forwarded to 3DS framebuffers via ARM11 DMA:

- [3DS Video LGY Registers (Legacy GBA/NDS Video to Framebuffer)](#3dsvideolgyregisterslegacygbandsvideotoframebuffer)
GBA Audio requires enabling amplifiers via TSC register, and enabling GBA sound
via CODEC\_SNDEXCNT.

NDS/DSi sound probably requires something similar, and more extensive TSC
initialization for NDS or DSi touchscreen mode; and adjusting the TSC
calibration points depending on whether using LGYFB scaling.



## 10018000h - ARM7\_CNT (R/W)

  2-31  Unused (0)
```

After writing ARM7\_CNT, apply the mode value by writing [10141100h].bit15=1
(CFG11\_TWLMODE\_BOOT). GBA/NDS/DSi mode will start ARM7, executing the
ARM7\_BOOTCODE.

NDS/DSi mode changes the ARM9 memory map (to survive the changed memory map,
ARM9 should execute ITCM code during the mode change). GBA mode does keep ARM9
in 3DS mode. ARM11 is always kept running in 3DS mode.



## 10018080h..1001809Fh - ARM7\_BOOTCODE (32 bytes) (R/W)


These 32 bytes do overlay the exception vectors at 00000000h..0000001Fh in the
ARM7 BIOS ROMs (for GBA/NDS/DSi mode). The ARM7 reset vector opcode(s) are
executed after switching to GBA/NDS/DSi mode (see ARM7\_CNT
CFG11\_TWLMODE\_BOOT.bit15).

After booting, ARM7 can disable the BOOTCODE overlay by writing [4700000h]=1.

To get the current time:

```
  Set Read flag, wait until busy=0, then read RTC_HEX or RTC_BCD registers
```

To set the current time:

```
  Write RTC_HEX registers, then set Write flag, then wait until busy=0
  (this does also set BCD registers, the hardware auto-converts HEX to BCD)
```

The initial time on power-up in 01 Jan 2000, 00:00:00. The actual battery
backed time can be obtained from MCU[30h..36h].

The GBA software can access the RTC via port 080000C4h, 080000C6h, 080000C8h.

  20000000h --> 08000000h, GBA Cart ROM (32Mbyte max)
```

Cart ROM is unstable: About 99% reads are reading from addr+20h (within
800h-byte pages), and about 1% are randomly reading as wanted from address+0.

```
  see FCRAM_MODE.bit0 for workaround
```

When in GBA mode, ARM9 seems to be no longer able to access the remapped ARM9
memory blocks (ARM9 only sees 00h's)? And, ARM9/ARM11 seem to HANG (without any
exception) when trying to access Main RAM at 20000000h?

Main RAM needs enable in EXMEMCNT, Main RAM uses only the lower 16bit of the
64bit FCRAM data bus (ie. only each 4th halfword is used). OAM/Palette need
enable in POWCNT1. VRAM needs enable in VRAMCNT. New Shared WRAM needs MBK.
Wifi RAM needs POWCNT2.



## GBA Footers


GBA ROM-images are reportedly stored in .code files (in NCCH .app files, which
can also contain the usual NCCH icon/banner/logo).

Nintendo is using 360h-byte footers in GBA ROM-images (at the end of the .code
file?).

- Config Data:
  - 000h 4    Unknown (usually 0) (maybe ROM-image Offset, or version)
  - 004h 4    ROM-image Size (usually Romsize)
  - 008h 4    Cartridge Type (Port 10018100h, ARM7\_SAVE\_TYPE)
  - 00Ch 4    Unknown (usually 0000FFFFh) (guess: savedata fillvalue?)

  - 020h 4    LCD Ghosting (01h..FFh) (uh, what is that?)
  - 024h 300h LCD Video LUT (guess: maybe for Port 10400484h/10400584h or so?)

  - 358h 4    Descriptor List Offset (usually Romsize+330h)
  - 35Ch 4    Descriptor List Size   (usually 20h) (2\*10h)



## GBA Savedata


Upon power-off, GBA savedata is usually temporarily stored in a small eMMC
partition, and later copied to the actual savedata file upon reboot. The file
format and filename for that savedata are unknown...?



## ARM7 Registers Misc...


ARM7 has the GBA BIOS implemented in hardware. The BIOS is completely identical
to the original GBA BIOS (uh, actually, it is the GBA BIOS version from NDS,
which has [3F0Ch]=01h).

The system is booted silently by calling SWI 01h (aka RegisterRamReset),
followed by jumping to the code that does SWI 00h (aka SoftReset) to finish
booting. The boot splash is still in BIOS, however, and can be seen by calling
or replacing one of the previous interrupts with SWI 26h (aka HardReset).

ARM7\_BOOTCODE: "This is the first code that will be run after execution begins.
TwlProcess9 uses this to put ARM7 in a loop (TWL), and to set the POSTFLG and
branch to more copied code (GBA)."

# <a name="3dsspiregisters"></a>3DS SPI Registers




## SPI Registers


There are four SPI buses (most of them can have up to 3 devices attached):

```
  1000D000h ARM9        SPI_CARD (savedate in game card SPI FLASH memory)
  10160000h ARM9/ARM11  SPI_BUS0 (0=Powerman, 1=Wifi-FLASH, 2=Touchscr/sound)
  10142000h ARM9/ARM11  SPI_BUS1 (0=Touchscr/sound with extra 3ds registers)
  10143000h ARM9/ARM11  SPI_BUS2 (unused)
```

The separate registers (at the above base addresses) are:

```
  10xxx000h 2   SPI_MANUAL_CNT    (R/W)  ;\Manual Access
  10xxx002h 1/2 SPI_MANUAL_DATA   (R/W)  ;/
  10xxx800h 4   SPI_FIFO_CNT      (R/W)  ;\
  10xxx804h 4   SPI_FIFO_DONE     (R/W)  ;
  10xxx808h 4   SPI_FIFO_BLKLEN   (R/W)  ; FIFO Access
  10xxx80Ch 4   SPI_FIFO_DATA     (R/W)  ; (and AUTOPOLL for
  10xxx810h 4   SPI_FIFO_STATUS   (R)    ; status reads)
  10xxx814h 4   SPI_AUTOPOLL      (R/W)  ;
  10xxx818h 4   SPI_FIFO_INT_MASK (R/W)  ;
  10xxx81Ch 4   SPI_FIFO_INT_STAT (R/ack);/
```

Interrupt IDs and DMA/FIFO startup/peripheral IDs are:

```
  SPI_CARD   ARM9 IF.bit23    Various (ARM9 NDMA and ARM9 XDMA)
  SPI_BUS0   ARM11 IRQ 56h    ARM11 CDMA 0Fh
  SPI_BUS1   ARM11 IRQ 57h    ARM11 CDMA 10h
  SPI_BUS2   ARM11 IRQ 24h    ARM11 CDMA 11h
```



## Config registers


```
  CFG11_SPI_CNT - mode select for SPI_BUS0,1,2 (Manual or Fifo)
  CFG9_CARD_CTL - mode select for SPI_CARD     (Manual or Fifo or NTRCARD)
```

- [3DS Config - CONFIG11 Registers](#3dsconfigconfig11registers)
- [3DS Config - CONFIG9 Registers](#3dsconfigconfig9registers)

```
 ___________________________ SPI Manual Access Mode ___________________________
```



## 10xxx000h - SPI\_MANUAL\_CNT



## 10xxx002h - SPI\_MANUAL\_DATA


Manual access mode works same as on DSi. Max transfer rate is 8MHz, 1bit mode
only, and the manual byte-by-byte transfer adds some software overload to the
transfer time.

- [DS Serial Peripheral Interface Bus (SPI)](ds.html#dsserialperipheralinterfacebusspi)
One advantage is that the manual mode supports true bi-directional SPI
transfers (which aren't really needed because most SPI chips use only one
direction at a time, with dummy data in opposite direction).


```
 ____________________________ SPI FIFO Access Mode ____________________________
```



## 10xxx800h - SPI\_FIFO\_CNT (R/W)


```
  0-2   Baudrate   (0=512KHz, 1=1MHz, 2=2MHz, 3=4MHz, 4=8MHz, 5..7=16MHz)
  3-5   Unused (0)
  6-7   SPI_BUS0-2: Device Select (0..2, or 3=Hangs/Reads as 2)
        SPI_CARD:   Unused (0)
  8-11  Unused (0)
  12    Bus Mode                (0=1bit, 1=4bit)
  13    Transfer Direction      (0=Read, 1=Write)
  14    Unused (0)
  15    Start Transfer          (0=Idle/Ready, 1=Start/Busy)
  16-31 Unused (0)
```

CARD: This register seems to have a bug where the lower 8 bits are shifted up
by 16 when reading this register. Uh, really?



## 10xxx804h - SPI\_FIFO\_DONE (R/W) (or R when busy?)


```
  0     Chip Select             (0=Not Selected, 1=Selected)
  1-31  Unused (0)
```

Select occurs automatically (when starting a transfer via SPI\_FIFO\_CNT).
However, deselect must be done manually (by writing 0 to SPI\_FIFO\_DONE after
last data block). This allows to keep the chip selected during multiple
transfer blocks (including blocks with different data direction, eg. WriteCmd +
ReadData).



## 10xxx808h - SPI\_FIFO\_BLKLEN (R/W) (or R when busy?)


```
  0-20  Transfer length (1..1FFFFFh bytes, 0=?)
  21-31 Unused (0)
```



## 10xxx80Ch - SPI\_FIFO\_DATA (R/W)


```
  0-31  32bit FIFO for reading/writing data
```



## 10xxx810h - SPI\_FIFO\_STATUS (R)


```
  0     Whatever FIFO busy... or FIFO full (0=Not full, 1=Full)
  1-31  unknown/unspecified
```

"At transfer start and every 32 bytes the FIFO becomes busy."

Uh, unknown if this refers to Send FIFO or Receive FIFO. For the latter having
a Empty flag would be most useful.

Might be also a generic "data request" flag, rather than a "full/busy" flag?



## 10xxx814h - SPI\_AUTOPOLL (R/W)


```
  0-7   Command byte (eg. 05h=RDSR, aka FLASH read status)
  8-15  Unused (0)
  16-19 Timeout    (0..10 = 1ms,2ms,4ms,8ms,..,512ms,1024ms, or 11..15=Never)
  20-23 Unused (0)
  24-26 Bit number (0..6=Bit0..6, or 7=Bugged?, always "ready" after 1st poll?)
  27-29 Unused (0)
  30    Bit value  (0=WaitUntilZero, 1=WaitUntilSet)
  31    Start Poll (0=Idle/Ready, 1=Start/Busy)
```

Autopoll does repeatedly transfer command+reply bytes, until reaching the
desired reply bit state (or until reaching timeout). Autopoll uses the device
number and baudrate selected in SPI\_FIFO\_CNT.



## 10xxx818h - SPI\_FIFO\_INT\_MASK (R/W) (or R when busy?)


```
  0     Transfer Finished Interrupt Disable  (0=Enable, 1=Disable)
  1     Autopoll Success Interrupt Disable   (0=Enable, 1=Disable)
  2     Autopoll Timeout Interrupt Disable   (0=Enable, 1=Disable)
  3     Unknown (R/W)                        (?)
  4-31  Unused (0)
```



## 10xxx81Ch - SPI\_FIFO\_INT\_STAT (R/ack)


```
  0     Transfer Finished Flag   (0=No, 1=Yes/IRQ) (write 1 to clear)
  1     Autopoll Success Flag    (0=No, 1=Yes/IRQ) (write 1 to clear)
  2     Autopoll Timeout Flag    (0=No, 1=Yes/IRQ) (write 1 to clear)
  3     Unknown (usually 0, but might be something related to INT_MASK.bit3 ?)
  4-31  Unused (0)
```

Bit0 also fires on each autopoll try? No: it does not fire on autopoll.

  Card, Device 1,2    Don't exist (there are no device-select bits for card)
```



## SPI Bus/Device 0:0 - Power Managment Device


The old power managment SPI registers are mostly for NDS mode:

- [DS Power Management Device](ds.html#dspowermanagementdevice)
On 3DS, backlight and power-down are controlled via MCU.



## SPI Bus/Device 0:1 - Wifi FLASH


This chip did contain the firmware in NDS consoles. On 3DS it does merely
contain some wifi/user settings, mostly for NDS titles.

- [DS Firmware Serial Flash Memory](ds.html#dsfirmwareserialflashmemory)
- [DS Firmware Header](ds.html#dsfirmwareheader)
- [DS Firmware Wifi Calibration Data](ds.html#dsfirmwarewificalibrationdata)
- [DS Firmware Wifi Internet Access Points](ds.html#dsfirmwarewifiinternetaccesspoints)
- [DS Firmware User Settings](ds.html#dsfirmwareusersettings)
The 3DS does probably additionally store User settings (and maybe also Wifi
Acess Point info) in a eMMC file, but unknown where?



## SPI Bus/Device 0:2 - DSi Touchscreen/Sound (DSi mode)


This SPI bus is used for accessing the TSC chip in DSi mode.

- [DSi Touchscreen/Sound Controller](ds.html#dsitouchscreensoundcontroller)
Touchscreen calibration points for NDS/DSi titles are in Wifi FLASH (matched to
the current NDS/DSi screen resolution, which can be 256x192pix or fullscreen;
selected by holding Start+Select when starting NDS/DSi title).



## SPI Bus/Device 1:0 - 3DS Touchscreen/Sound (3DS mode)


This is another SPI bus wired to the TSC chip, this bus can be accessed in 3DS
mode only, giving access to the normal DSi registers, plus some additional 3DS
registers in TSC page 64h,65h,67h,FBh. These new registers are required for
activating sound output, and for reading the Circle Pad.

- [3DS TSC, Register Summary](#3dstscregistersummary)
Touchscreen calibration points for 3DS titles are stored in HWCAL0/1.dat files,
that files do also include calibration data for Circle Pad, and various initial
TSC register settings.



## Cartridge SPI


Cartridge SPI can be wired to FLASH savedata (or theoretically anything else).

This can use 4bit SPI mode (if the chip is 4bit compatible, and if 4bit related
signals are wired up accordingly, and if the specific commands support 4bit
transfers).

The 3DS does usually access only the registers mentioned above (but there are
many more DSi-style registers in page 00h,01h,03h; see DSi chapter for
details).

The above coefficient RAM pages exists on DSi, too. However, the DSi is usually
initializing only those in page 04h.

Unknown how the 3DS is using the extra coefficients... does it use miniDSP
instructions for that?

Unknown what the duplicated entries are for... maybe left/right channels?

Bit1=0 appends a short fixed delay after each byte. Bit1=1 will automatically
wait if the SCL clock pin is held low: If the peripheral doesn't do that then
it can be even slightly faster than the fixed delay, if the peripheral does
hold SCL low then the 3DS will wait as long as needed (eg. required for
3DS/New3DS MCU and New3DS C-Stick).

The fastest setting (0000h) is about 380kHz (about 41Kbyte/s).

The slowest setting (1F3Fh) is about 84kHz (about 9Kbyte/s)

Hmmm, or maybe the raw bitrate is faster, but with short pause between bytes?

# <a name="3dsi2cmcuregistersummary"></a>3DS I2C MCU Register Summary




## Bus/Device 1:4Ah - MCU


The McuIndex is usually automatically incremented after each data byte (eg.
allowing to read the two Version bytes in one pass).

However, there are a few arrays (at McuIndex=29h,2Dh,4Fh,61h,7Fh), which will
increment the ArrayIndex instead of the McuIndex. This happens only if the
index value (in the I2C command) was pointing to the array (eg. writing 5 bytes
to index 29h will update the Power LED Array. But, writing 5 bytes to index 28h
will update McuIndex 28h,29h,2Ah,2Bh,2Ch; without getting stuck at 29h, and
thus updating only the 1st byte of the Power LED Array).

The extra-special case is using index 60h in the I2C command (it will increment
once, then stay at index 61h).

## Blurb


On old versions of MCU\_FIRM none of the invalid registers are masked away by
the read handler function, but are still read-only. Newer MCU\_FIRM versions
return the hardcoded value FF instead.

Reportedly register 3Bh (RTC Alarm month) "could be used on very old MCU\_FIRM
versions to upload MCU firmware if some conditions (?) are met", uh?.




# <a name="3dsi2cmcu00h01h05h07hfirmware"></a>3DS I2C MCU[00h-01h,05h-07h] - Firmware




## MCU[00h] - Version high (bit0-3) and hardware.type? (bit4-7) (R)



## MCU[01h] - Version low (8bit) (R)


```
  OldMCU: Version 0.008 or lower   ;\differs on LCD bits:
  NewMCU: Version 0.009 or higher  ;/backlight and "push"
```



## MCU[05h-07h] - MCU Firmware update unlock sequence ;ARRAY[4003h] (R/W)


Updating MCU Firmware FLASH is done by writing 4003h bytes to MCU[05h and up].
The I2C transfer timings (and flash write timings) are automatically handled
via SCL-hold. The upload takes about 2 seconds, and the console does then
reboot the MCU... the backlights stay on, but I2C MCU access seems to be
non-functional... for a while?

The first three bytes must be 6Ah,68h,6Ch (aka "jhl"), if the 3rd write does
match (and 1st-2nd write were also correct), then the MCU switches to receiving
a 4000h-byte firmware image. The image consists of two blocks:

```
  1000h bytes written to flash address 0000h-0FFFh (4K)
  3000h bytes written to flash address 2000h-4FFFh (12K)
```

For error checking, the image must contain three identical 9-byte
"HH:MM:SS",00h timestamps:

```
  0FF6h..0FFEh - 1st timestamp
  2000h..2008h - 2nd timestamp
  4FF6h..4FFEh - 3rd timestamp
```

The first byte of the timestamp must be other than FFh, and the third byte must
be ":".

BUG: The 1st/3rd timestamp are checked before applying the firmware update, but
2nd timestamp isn't checked until AFTER applying it (then causing blinking red
power led, and requiring the reflash via UART pin).

- [3DS I2C MCU - RL78 Flash Programming via UART](#3dsi2cmcurl78flashprogrammingviauart)
Uploading bugged code may also require reflashing via UART (the UART stuff is
handled in ROM, and works safely even if the whole flash is erased).



## Firmware Inner Workings


The MCU contains a RL78 processor with reflashable firmware.

## Firmware Nocash MCU Patches


Code Execution in Battery RAM:

```
  MCU[05h-07h] = "exc"  --> Battery RAM code gets executed immediately
  MCU[05h-07h] = "exq"  --> Battery RAM code gets enqueued as callback
  Before execution, use MCU[61h] to upload code to Battery RAM, the RAM
  can be also used to store parameters and return values, you may want to
  restore the original RAM content after execution for not confusing the OS.
  The ROM/RAM memory map varies for different MCU firmware versions, however,
  the patched firmware provides useful ROM/RAM addresses in below tables,
  code should either use relative jumps, or addresses from those tables.
```

Call Table Vectors for ROM functions:

```
  00080h  Process Standard Callbacks    ;\
  00082h  Add Callback AX               ; Nintendo's own stuff (not useful)
  00084h  Process Enqueued Callbacks    ;/
  000B4h  I2C_Receive_Block             ;\Slave I2C recv/send (can be used
  000B6h  I2C_Send_Block                ;/from within callbacks only)
  000B8h  FLASH Init and kill IRQs      ;\
  000BAh  FLASH Erase 400h bytes        ; FLASH init/erase/write/finish
  000BCh  FLASH Write max 100h bytes    ; (eg. for custom code in backup area)
  000BEh  FLASH Finish 400h bytes       ;/
```

Pointers to RAM arrays:

```

  F4FEAh  MCU[61h] Battery RAM     (C8h bytes)  ; Pointers to RAM arrays
  F4FECh  MCU[2Dh] Notify LED RAM  (64h bytes)  ;
  F4FEEh  MCU[4Fh] Pedometer_array (150h bytes) ;/
```

Other General Patches:

```
  Faster power button tap duration (0s instead laggy delay)
  Faster power button hold duration (1s instead 3s)
  Changed Power LED color upon holding power button (purple)
  Faster shutdown after holding power button (can be 0s instead 12s)
  Faster shutdown after normal power down (omitting LED fade-out delay)
```



## Firmware Image/Dumping


A copy of the firmware-image can be found in the System Modules folder,

```
  3ds:\title\00040130\00001f02\content\000000vv.app ;MCU
  3ds:\title\00040130\20001f02\content\000000vv.app ;MCU New3DS
  3ds:\title\00040130\00001f03\content\000000vv.app ;MCU Safe mode
  3ds:\title\00040130\20001f03\content\000000vv.app ;MCU Safe mode New3DS
```

The .app file contains a .code file with ARM11 code (and the MCU firmware
somewhere inside of that .code file, usually at file offset A078h or A07Ch;
starting with the 3-byte unlock code ("jhl"), followed by the 4000h-byte
firmware image).

Dumping the firmware directly from FLASH memory isn't supported. However, one
could patch the firmware, and then dump the backup of the old version (that
will destroy the backup of the yet older version though).

## Legacy RTC Emulation


The 3DS can emulate GBA/NDS/DSi RTC's. That is, the 3DS software must read the
battery-backed time from MCU RTC registers, and then copy it to the emulated
RTC registers...

                An up/down movement (on whichever axis that corresponds      ;
                to gravity direction) is treated as step; however, the       ;
                first step isn't counted, so 5 continous steps would         ;
                increment the counter by 4.                                  ;

```

Reading the Output X/Y/Z registers would be the normal way to get the
accelerometer data (if enabled in the mode register).



## Pedometer (Step counter)


The Pedometer is some software feature in the MCU that converts the
accelerometer data to step counters.

Power-off switches the accelerometer power supply off. However, it is kept
powered & can do step counting in sleep mode. Step counting is used for
"Play Coins" and the pre-installed statistic tool "Omoide Kirokuchou" (probably
has other name in english?).



## Manual access to Accelerometer I2C registers


The manual read/write feature allows to view/modify I2C registers directly; for
debugging/hacking purposes or so. The manual read/write seem to be done in a
callback function (=not immediately after writing MCU[41h] or MCU[44h]), and,
before touching further accelerometer registers, one must wait until the
callback has executed (which is indicated by MCU.interrupt.bit11).



## Accelerometer Chip


On Old3DS it is marked "2048, 33DH, X1MAQ", which is said to be ST LIS331DLH.

On New3DSXL it is marked "KXTKK, 40860, .3413", which might be a Kionix chip,
resembling KXTIK, but with LIS331DLH-style register map & device address.

Both Old3DS and New3DSXL have the chip on the mainboard, somewhere underneath
of the bottom-screen. That (and the exact location) may be important when
interpreting the accelerometer data (ie. the chip isn't parallel with the
top-screen unless the case is fully unfolded).

The Accelerometer chip is wired to the MCU, so it's I2C registers can be
accessed only indirectly, through the MCU.

  5-7 PM   Power mode selection (0=Power-down, Other: see Table 19) (default=0)
```

PM bits allow to select between power-down and two operating active modes. The
device is in power-down mode when PD bits are set to "000" (default value after
boot). Table 19 shows all the possible power mode configurations and respective
output data rates. Output data in the low-power modes are computed with
low-pass filter cut-off frequency defined by DR1, DR0 bits.

DR bits, in the normal-mode operation, select the data rate at which
acceleration samples are produced. In low-power mode they define the output
data resolution. Table 20 shows all the possible configuration for DR1 and DR0
bits.

Table 19. Power mode and low-power output data rate configurations:

```

  5-6 HPM   High pass filter mode   (0=Normal mode, Other=see Table 23)
  7   BOOT  Reboot memory content   (0=Normal mode, 1=Reboot memory content)
```

BOOT bit is used to refresh the content of internal registers stored in the
flash memory block. At the device power up the content of the flash memory
block is transferred to the internal registers related to trimming functions to
permit a good behavior of the device itself.

If for any reason the content of trimming registers was changed it is
sufficient to use this bit to restore correct values. When BOOT=1 the content
of internal flash is copied inside corresponding internal registers and it is
used to calibrate the device. These values are factory trimmed and they are
different for every accelerometer. They permit a good behavior of the device
and normally they have not to be changed. At the end of the boot process the
BOOT bit is set again to 0.

                                    not updated between MSB and LSB reading)
```

BDU bit is used to inhibit output registers update between the reading of upper
and lower register parts. In default mode (BDU=0) the lower and upper register
parts are updated continuously. If it is not sure to read faster than output
data rate, it is recommended to set BDU=1. In this way, after the reading of
the lower (upper) register part, the content of that output registers is not
updated until the upper (lower) part is read too.

This feature avoids reading LSB and MSB related to different samples.



## ACCL[24h] - CTRL\_REG5 - Sleep to Wake Control (R/W)


```
  0-1  Turn-on mode selection for sleep to wake function (0 or 3)
  2-7  Reserved (0)
```

TurnOn bits are used for turning on the sleep to wake function.

```
  Table 32. Sleep to wake configuration
  TurnOn  Sleep to wake status
  00h     Sleep to wake function is disabled
  03h     Turned on: The device is in low power mode (ODR=Defined in CTRL_REG1)
```

Setting TurnOn=3 the "sleep to wake" function is enabled. When an interrupt
event occurs the device is turned to normal mode increasing the ODR to the
value defined in CTRL\_REG1. Although the device is in normal mode, CTRL\_REG1
content is not automatically changed to "normal mode" configuration.



## ACCL[25h] - HP\_FILTER\_RESET - High-Pass Filter Clear content (R=clear)


Dummy register. Reading at this address zeroes instantaneously the content of
the internal high pass-filter. If the high pass filter is enabled all three
axes are instantaneously set to 0g.

This allows to overcome the settling time of the high pass filter.



## ACCL[26h] - REFERENCE - High-pass Filter Reference value (R/W)


```
  0-7  Reference value for high-pass filter. Default=00h
```

This register sets the acceleration value taken as a reference for the
high-pass filter output.

When filter is turned on (at least one of FDS, HPen2, or HPen1 bit is equal to
1) and HPM bits are set to "01", filter out is generated taking this value as a
reference.



## ACCL[27h] - STATUS\_REG - Output Status (R)


```
  0  XDA    New X axis new data available           (0=No, 1=Available)
  1  YDA    New Y axis new data available           (0=No, 1=Available)
  2  ZDA    New Z axis new data available           (0=No, 1=Available)
  3  ZYXDA  New set of X,Y,Z axis available         (0=No, 1=Available)

  7  ZYXOR  Overrun has overwritten X,Y,Z axis data (0=No, 1=Overrun)
```

Overrun means that previous data got overwritten before it was read.

Unknown if the Status bits get cleared after reading the Status register, or
after reading the Output registers, or elsewhere?

Reading at this address clears INTn\_SRC.bit6 (and the interrupt signal on INTn
pin) and allows the refreshment of data in the INTn\_SRC register if the latched
option was chosen.



## ACCL[32h] - INT1\_THS - Interrupt 1 threshold (R/W)



## ACCL[36h] - INT2\_THS - Interrupt 1? threshold (R/W)

These bits set the minimum duration of the Interrupt 2(?) event to be
recognized. Duration time steps and maximum values depend on the ODR chosen.

## MCU[60h] - Battery-backed RAM Index (R/W)



## MCU[61h] - Battery-backed RAM Data (200 bytes) ;ARRAY[C8h] (R/W)


This is a battery-backed 200-byte general purpose RAM area. The MCU itself
doesn't care about the RAM content. Instead, the ARM CPU can use it to store
powerdown/error flags (and then check those flags on next boot).

- The 1st byte at array[00h] is used to store flags for managing FIRM/NS state:
  - bit0 = "WirelessDisabled"
  - bit1 = "SoftwareClosed"
  - bit2 = "PowerOffInitiated"
  - bit4 = "LegacyJumpProhibited"

When exceeding the C8h-byte array size: Writing to index=C8h..FFh is ignored
(and the index is not incremented). Reading from index=C8h..FFh returns
data=00h (and the index is incremented, and can wrap from index=FFh to
index=00h).

The fuel gauge registers are 16bit, big-endian (eg.
"write(device,index,msb,lsb)").

One should always read/write 2 bytes. Trying to read a single byte from odd
index does instead return the msb from even index. Trying to read more than 2
bytes does weirdly return each 2-byte pair TWICE, and does then advance to the
next 2-byte pair.

Old3DS uses a small 8pin fuel gauge with marking 17040, which is apparently
Maxim MAX17040.

New3DS uses a very tiny 8pin bga fuel gauge with marking 7048, which might be
Maxim MAX17048 (although the MCU firmware uses some undocumented registers that
aren't mentioned in MAX17048 datasheet). The MCU firmware seems to detect
different fuel gauge versions/revisions, unknown which different chip(s) are
used (eg. Richtek RT9428 would be also compatible).

as one-directional level changer (with replies ignored/skipped via hardcoded
delays), an additional 10K-65K resistor and BC547 transistor can be used for
bi-directional transfers.

  xxh 1     Data End (03h=Last Data Frame, or 17h=More data frames follow)
```



## Reset Command (aka Start/Sync)


Drag FLDM0 high (1.8V in 3DS) to enable programming mode, and drag /RESET low
for a moment. Then exchange the following bytes/packets.

Low Pulse (from chip, should arrive within 10ms after releasing /RESET):

```
  00h 1     Low pulse (value 00h)  ;-transferred at 9600 bps
```

Low Pulses (to chip):

```
  00h 1     Low pulse (value 00h)  ;\chip autodetects baudrate based on
  01h 1     Low pulse (value 00h)  ;/transfer time for these two bytes
```

Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,01h,00h)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```



## Set Baudrate Command


Allows to set the baudrate, which isn't really needed because the baudrate is
autodetected when sending the Reset pulses.

Recommended might be 57.6Kbps, higher rates aren't really useful because of the
slow write duration. Tested/working rates are 9.6Kbps through 115.2Kbps,
including odd nonstandard rates.

Bytes should be sent as 8N2 (8 databits, no parity, 2 stopbits). However, the
chip seems to send only 1 stopbit. Nethertheless, it seems to insist on
receiving 2 stopbits (alternately, one could send the 2nd stopbit before
startbit).

Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,06h,9Ah)
  03h 1     Sync/Connection Mode (00h=Microcontroller, 1=Programmer)
  04h 2     Baud rate, in whatever units
  06h 1     Noise filter (00h=Off, 01h=On)
  07h 1     Speed/voltage (00h=Fast 2.7V and up, 01h=Slow 1.8V and up)
  08h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```



## Chip Erase Command


Erases the whole flash memory & security settings (unless the security
settings did have disabled the Chip Erase command itself).

Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,01h,20h)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (chip erase result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```



## Block Erase Command


Blocks seem to be 1Kbyte (400h bytes). Erasing 1000h bytes at once does also
work.

Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,07h,22h)
  03h 3     Start address (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 10bit=000h  ;\400h byte boundary
  06h 3     End address   (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 10bit=3FFh  ;/
  09h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (block erase result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```



## Block Blank Check Command


Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,08h,32h)
  03h 3     Start address (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 10bit=000h  ;\400h byte boundary
  06h 3     End address   (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 10bit=3FFh  ;/
  09h 1     Type (00h=Before single block, 01h=Before chip erase)
  0Ah 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (block blank check result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```



## Write Command


Requires prior Erase command, max length for erase/write commands seems to be
1000h bytes. To quit flash mode & resume normal operation, it seems to be
required to unplug battery supply for moment after having written all data.

Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,07h,40h)
  03h 3     Start address (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 8bit=00h  ;\100h byte boundary
  06h 3     End address   (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 8bit=FFh  ;/
  09h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip, after command):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (command reception result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Data (to chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,LEN) ;LEN=1..255 bytes, or 0=256 bytes
  02h LEN   Data (usually 256 bytes)
  xxh 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h/17h)  ;03h=Last, 17h=Nonlast
```

Response (from chip, circa 60ms after each data block):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,02h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (data reception result)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (write result)
  04h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip, extra response, about 1.5 seconds after LAST data block):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (internal verify result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Note: The ugly 1.5 seconds verify delay can avoided by issuing a chip reset
instead of waiting for the final response.



## Verify/Compare Command


Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,07h,13h)
  03h 3     Start address (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 8bit=00h  ;\100h byte boundary
  06h 3     End address   (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 8bit=FFh  ;/
  09h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip, after command):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (command reception result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Data (to chip):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,LEN)  ;LEN must be N*4 bytes (usually (1)00h bytes)
  02h LEN   Data
  xxh 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h/17h)  ;03h=Last, 17h=Nonlast
```

Response (from chip, after each data block):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,02h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (data reception result)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (verify result) (always ACK/okay for Nonlast?)
  04h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

With data LEN=4, this seems to allow dump the chip content via brute-force (but
requires to send/receive trillions of bits to dump 4 bytes, and gets slower
towards end of 100h-byte snippets).



## Get Checksum Command


Command (to chip):

```
  00h 3     Start/Len/Command (01h,07h,B0h)
  03h 3     Start address (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 8bit=00h  ;\100h byte boundary
  06h 3     End address   (MSB,MID,LSB) ;lower 8bit=FFh  ;/blah: "from top 1KB"
  09h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Response (from chip, after command):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,01h)
  02h 1     Status/Error code (command reception result)
  03h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

Data (from chip, after above response):

```
  00h 2     Start/Len (02h,02h)
  02h 2     Data checksum, 0000h minus all data bytes (MSB,LSB)
  04h 2     Checksum/End      (CHK,03h)
```

## Notes


The above protocol is documented in the "78K0R/Kx3-L Flash Memory Programming"
application note.

Unknown if verify/checksum could be tweaked to dump the current flash content.
There is also an undocumented anti-dumping feature related to bytes at 000C4h
(that's probably related to TOOL1 debug pin, not to TOOL0 serial flash pin).

Opcode FFh = TRAP (illegal opcode, used by 3DS MCU, triggers Reset vector).

Uh, other/prefixed illegal opcodes do not act as TRAP?

  "saddr.#" and "sfr.#" with #=8..15 could be implemented as "addr+1.#-8".
  "callt [nn]" can be seen as 2-byte alias for "call nnnn" (via the ROM table)

# <a name="3dsi2cmcurl78cpuregistersandflags"></a>3DS I2C MCU - RL78 CPU Registers and Flags




## Registers


```
  PC   20bit   Program Counter
  PSW  8bit    Program Status Word (flags)
  SP   16bit   Stack Pointer (bit0=always 0, bit1-15=used)
  AX   16bit   aka A:X   ;\these can be used as 16bit (eg. AX) or two 8bit
  BC   16bit   aka B:C   ; registers (eg. A and X).
  DE   16bit   aka D:E   ; all of these registers exist in 4 banks (the
  HL   16bit   aka H:L   ;/active bank is selected via "SEL RBn" opcode)
  ES   4bit    Data Bank ;-used only for PREFIX'ed opcode, otherwise bank=0Fh
  CS   4bit    Code Bank ;-MSBs of destination for JMP/CALL AX/BC/DE/HL
```

Note: All registers (except PC) are mapped to the SFR register area, and can be
also used by accessing that memory. In case of the banked AX/BC/DE/HL
registers, observe that direct memory access won't recurse the current "bank"
selection (that weird feature/problem is same as for 8051 CPUs).

Note: Opcodes that use PSW or PSW.n or CY as destination operand do of course
also affect the corresponding flags.



## RL78 Conditional Opcodes


The CPU supports conditional branch/skip opcodes. Skip does skip the next
opcode if the condition is true (unknown if that is any faster, especially in
case of large 5-byte opcodes). Combining conditional SKx+BT/BF is possible.

There are no conditions for signed overflow/less/greater. Signed
positive/negative can be tested via BF/BT on result.bit7/bit15.

The skip feature could be used as prefix for making conditional opcodes, eg.
"ADD.Z" could be made of "SKNZ+ADD" (to add if zero).

# <a name="3dsi2cmcurl78sfrregistersspecialfunctionregistersioports"></a>3DS I2C MCU - RL78 SFR Registers (Special Function Registers) (I/O ports)




## Datasheets


SFRs are documented in RL78 Hardware Manuals. However, the SFRs aren't 100%
same for all RL78 chips. The "78K0R/KC3-L, 78K0R/KE3-L" datasheet appears to be
pretty close to the 3DS hardware (aside from the F0500h-F07FFh area).

## Register Description


The register space allows single-byte reads and writes, as well as burst reads
and writes. When performing burst reads or writes, the memory pointer will
increment until reading or writing is terminated by the master, or until the
memory pointer reaches "certain reserved registers between 21h and 3Ch" (uh,
that would include GYRO\_ZOUT at 21h and/or 22h?).

Note that any bit that is not defined should be set to zero.



## GYRO[00h] - WHO\_AM\_I - Device ID (R/W)


```
  0    Reserved ("may be 0 or 1") (maybe ID.bit1, maybe R/W, or what?)    (?)
  1-6  I2C Device ID bit2-7 (initially 34h on power-up, aka D0h/4)        (R/W)
  7    Reserved ("should be 0")                                           (?)
```

Contains the upper 6bit of the 8bit I2C Device ID, can be used for detection,
the value is also write-able and can be changed after power-on.



## GYRO[15h] - SMPLRT\_DIV - Sample Rate Divider (R/W)


```
  0-7  Sample Rate Divider (00h..FFh=Divide by 1..100h) (initially 00h)
```

The gyros outputs are sampled internally at either 1kHz or 8kHz, determined by
the DLPF\_CFG setting (see register 22). This sampling is then filtered
digitally and delivered into the sensor registers after the number of cycles
determined by this register. The sample rate is given by the following formula:

```
  Fsample = Finternal / (divider+1)   ;where Finternal is either 1kHz or 8kHz
```

As an example, if the internal sampling is at 1kHz, then setting this register
to 7 would give the following:

```
  Fsample = 1kHz / (7 + 1) = 125Hz, or 8ms per sample
```



## GYRO[16h] - DLPF\_FS - Low Pass Filter and Full Scale Config (R/W)


```
  0-2  DLPF_CFG  Digital low pass filter bandwidth & internal sample rate
  3-4  FS_SEL    Full scale selection for gyro sensor data
  5-7  Reserved (should be 0)
```

FS\_SEL Gyro Full-Scale Range:

```
  0 Reserved (despite of being power-up default)
  1 Reserved
  2 Reserved
  3 +/-2000ø/sec (this should be used)
```

DLPF\_CFG, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth, Internal Sample Rate:

```
  0 Internal Sample Rate=8kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=256Hz
  1 Internal Sample Rate=1kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=188Hz
  2 Internal Sample Rate=1kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=98Hz
  3 Internal Sample Rate=1kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=42Hz
  4 Internal Sample Rate=1kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=20Hz
  5 Internal Sample Rate=1kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=10Hz
  6 Internal Sample Rate=1kHz, Low Pass Filter Bandwidth=5Hz
  7 Reserved
```



## GYRO[17h] - Interrupt Enable and INT Pin Configuration (R/W)


```
  0  Enable interrupt when new sample data is available           (1=Enable)
  1  -
  2  Enable interrupt when PLL ready ;after changing clock source (1=Enable)
  3  -
  4  Latch clear method (0=Status register read only, 1=Any register read);\
  5  Latch mode         (0=50us pulse, 1=latch until interrupt is cleared); INT
  6  Drive type for INT output pin  (0=push-pull, 1=open drain)           ; pin
  7  Logic level for INT output pin (0=active high, 1=active low)         ;/
```

Unknown what the PLL ready IRQ is good for, maybe the whole I2C bus becomes
unstable/inactive and shouldn't be used until receiving the IRQ?



## GYRO[1Ah] - Interrupt Status (R)


```
  0   New sample data is ready          (0=No, 1=Yes/IRQ)
  1   -
  2   PLL clock source change ready     (0=No, 1=Yes/IRQ)
  3-7 -
```

If the interrupt is not enabled, the associated status bit will NOT get set!

Interrupt Status bits are cleared after reading GYRO[1Ah] (or optionally, if
GYRO[17h].bit4=1, after reading any GYRO[xxh] register).



## GYRO[1Bh/1Ch] - TEMP\_OUT\_H/L signed 16bit Temperature data (R)



## GYRO[1Dh/1Eh] - GYRO\_XOUT\_H/L signed 16bit Gyro X output data (R)



## GYRO[1Fh/20h] - GYRO\_YOUT\_H/L signed 16bit Gyro Y output data (R)



## GYRO[21h/22h] - GYRO\_ZOUT\_H/L signed 16bit Gyro Y output data (R)


Sensor Registers. These values can be read at any time; however it is best to
use the interrupt function to determine when new data is available.



## GYRO[3Eh] - Power Management (R/W)


```
  0-2 CLK_SEL  Select device clock source  (see below)
  3   STBY_ZG  Gyro Z standby mode  (0=Normal, 1=Standby)  ;\eg. disable
  4   STBY_YG  Gyro Y standby mode  (0=Normal, 1=Standby)  ; unused axis
  5   STBY_XG  Gyro X standby mode  (0=Normal, 1=Standby)  ;/to save power
  6   SLEEP    Enable low power sleep mode (0=Normal, 1=Very low power sleep)
  7   H_RESET  Reset device and internal registers to power-up-default settings
```

The CLK\_SEL setting determines the device clock source as follows:

```
  0 Internal oscillator (default on power-up, but unreliable, PLLs are better)
  1 PLL with X Gyro reference
  2 PLL with Y Gyro reference
  3 PLL with Z Gyro reference
  4 PLL with external 32.768kHz reference  ;\unknown if available in 3DS,
  5 PLL with external 19.2MHz reference    ;/maybe from 32KHz RTC output?
  6 Reserved
  7 Reserved
```

## NEW\_GYRO[19h] - SMPLRT\_DIV - Sample Rate Divider (R/W)


```
  0-7  Sample Rate Divider (00h..FFh=Divide by 1..100h) (initially 00h)
```

This register specifies the divider from the gyroscope output rate that can be
used to generate a reduced Sample Rate.

```
  When FCHOICE_B=0 and DLPF_CFG=1..6   --> Sample Rate Divider IS USED
  When FCHOICE_B=0 and DLPF_CFG=0 or 7 --> Sample Rate is fixed at 8kHz ???
  When FCHOICE_B=1..3                  --> Sample Rate is fixed at 32kHz
```

The sensor register output and FIFO output are both based on the Sample Rate.

When this register is effective under the FCOICE\_B and DLPF\_CFG settings, the
reduced Sample Rate is generated by the formula below:

```
  Sample Rate = Gyroscope Output Rate / (1 + SMPLRT_DIV)
```

where Gyroscope Output Rate = 1kHz.



## NEW\_GYRO[1Ah] - CONFIG - Configuration (R/W)


```
  0-2 DLPF_CFG      Configures the Digital Low Pass Filter DLPF setting
  3-5 EXT_SYNC_SET  Configures the Frame Sync FSYNC pin sampling
  6   FIFO_MODE     FIFO Mode (0=Overwrite oldest data, 1=Stop when full)
  7   -             Reserved
```

Please note that the DLPF can only be used when FCHOICE\_B=0 (Register 27).

An external signal connected to the FSYNC pin can be sampled by configuring
EXT\_SYNC\_SET.

Signal changes to the FSYNC pin are latched so that short strobes may be
captured. The latched FSYNC signal will be sampled at the Sampling Rate, as
defined in register 25. After sampling, the latch will reset to the current
FSYNC signal state.

The sampled value will be reported in place of the least significant bit in a
sensor data register determined by the value of EXT\_SYNC\_SET according to the
following table.

```
  EXT_SYNC_SET  FSYNC Bit Location
  0             Input disabled
  1             TEMP_OUT_L.bit0

  3             GYRO_YOUT_L.bit0
  4             GYRO_ZOUT_L.bit0
```

The DLPF is configured by DLPF\_CFG, when FCHOICE\_B=0. The gyroscope and
temperature sensor are filtered according to the value of DLPF\_CFG and
FCHOICE\_B as shown in the table below.

```

FSYNC\_INT\_MODE\_EN: When bit2 is equal to 1, the FSYNC pin will trigger an
interrupt when it transitions to the level specified by FSYNC\_INT\_LEVEL. When a
FSYNC interrupt is triggered, the FSYNC\_INT bit in Register 58 will be set to
1. An interrupt is sent to the host processor if the FSYNC interrupt is enabled
by the FSYNC\_INT\_EN bit in Register 56.



## NEW\_GYRO[38h] - INT\_ENABLE - Interrupt Enable (R/W)

```
  0-15  Most recent sensor value, signed 16bit, updated at sample rate
```

These sensor registers [41h..48h], are composed of two sets of registers: an
internal register set and a user-facing read register set.

- The internal register set is always updated at the Sample Rate.
- The user-facing read register set duplicates the internal register set's
- data values whenever the serial interface is idle. This guarantees that a
- burst read of sensor registers will read measurements from the same sampling
- instant.

Note that if burst reads are not used, the user is responsible for ensuring a
set of single byte reads correspond to a single sampling instant by checking
the Data Ready interrupt.

Temperature: The scale factor and offset for the temperature sensor are found
in the Electrical Specifications table in Product Specification document.



## NEW\_GYRO[6Ah] - USER\_CTRL - User Control (R/W)

  02h = PLL  ; gyroscope based clock (PLL)
  03h = PLL  ;
  04h = PLL  ;
  05h = PLL  ;/
  06h = Internal 20MHz oscillator
  07h = Reserved
```

The PLL is the default clock source upon power up (uh, but all registers except
WHO\_AM\_I are said to be zero on power-up). In order for the gyroscope to
perform to spec, the PLL must be selected as the clock source.

When the internal 20MHz oscillator is chosen as the clock source, the device
can operate while having the gyroscopes disabled. However, this is only
recommended if the user wishes to use the internal temperature sensor in this
mode.

For further information regarding the device clock source, please refer to the
relevant "Product Specification document" (uh, but this sentence comes from the
Product Specification) and the Power Mode Transition Descriptions section in
the Appendix (uh, but there is no Appendix).

Reset: The default values for each register can be found in "Section 3", uh?



## NEW\_GYRO[6Ch] - PWR\_MGMT\_2 - Power Management 2 (R/W)

  3-5 -       Reserved bit(s)
  6-7 -       Reserved bit-pair?
```

To activate any gyro axis again, all three gyro axes must first be put into
standby mode, and then be turned on simultaneously.

If the user wishes to put all three gyro axes into standby mode, the internal
oscillator must be selected as the clock source.

If all three gyro axes are put into standby mode while the clock source of the
device is set to the PLL (with the gyro drive generating the reference clock),
the chip will hang due to an absence of a clock.

As long as one gyro axis is enabled, the drive circuit will remain active and
the PLL will provide a clock.



## NEW\_GYRO[72h/73h] - FIFO\_COUNTH/L - FIFO Count Register (10bit) (R/W)


```
  0-9   Number of bytes stored in the FIFO buffer (max=?)
  10-15 Reserved
```

The count value is latched when reading the High byte (ie. one can read
H-then-L without risking carry-outs from L to H during reading).



## NEW\_GYRO[74h] - FIFO\_R\_W - FIFO Read/Write Data (R/W)


```
  0-7   FIFO Data
```

This register is used to read and write(?) data from the FIFO buffer.

Data is written to the FIFO in order of register number, (from lowest to
highest). If all the FIFO enable flags (see below) are enabled, the contents of
NEW\_GYRO[41h..48h] will be written in order.



## NEW\_GYRO[75h] - WHO\_AM\_I - Device ID (always 68h) (R)


```
  0   Reserved ("Hard coded to 0")                               (R)
  1-6 I2C Device ID bit2-7 (always 34h, aka D0h/4 or D2h/4)      (R)
  7   Reserved ("Hard coded to 0")                               (R)
```

The device address D0h or D2h can be selected via AD0 pin (the AD0 pin is not
reflected in this register). This register is read-only (unlike as OLD\_GYRO).



## NEW\_GYRO[00h..0Dh] - Reserved/Undocumented


Reading these fourteen registers returns following weird values:

```
  BD DB D1 29 9C 1D 20 67 F4 1A 8C 08 B1 71
```

There should be 10bit temperature calibration values, but 9C1Dh,67F4h,8C08h
exceed 10bit range.

The first two bytes (BDh,DBh) seem to resemble the 1st/2nd bytes of older RS232
gyroscope protocols.

## IR[00h.DLAB=0.R] - RHR - Receive Holding Register (R)


The receiver section consists of the Receiver Holding Register (RHR) and the
Receiver Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The RSR
receives serial data from the RX pin. The data is converted to parallel data
and moved to the RHR. The receiver section is controlled by the Line Control
Register. If the FIFO is disabled, location zero of the FIFO is used to store
the characters.



## IR[00h.DLAB=0.W] - THR - Transmit Holding Register (W)


The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR) and the
Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte FIFO. The THR
receives data and shifts it into the TSR, where it is converted to serial data
and moved out on the TX pin. If the FIFO is disabled, the FIFO is still used to
store the byte. Characters are lost if overflow occurs.



## IR[10h.W] - FCR - FIFO Control Register (W)


```
  7-6  Trigger level for the RX FIFO (0..3 = 8,16,56,60 chars)
  5-4  Trigger level for the TX FIFO (0..3 = 8,16,32,56 spaces)
  3    Reserved
  2    TX FIFO Reset (0=No change, 1=Clear TX FIFO)
  1    RX FIFO Reset (0=No change, 1=Clear RX FIFO)
  0    RX/TX FIFO enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
```

Bit1,2: FIFO reset requires at least two XTAL1 clocks, therefore, they cannot
be reset without the presence of the XTAL1 clock.

Bit4-5: Can only be modified and enabled when EFR[4] is set. This is because
the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.



## IR[18h] - LCR - Line Control Register (R/W)


```

  1-0  Word length         (0=5bit, 1=6bit, 2=7bit, 3=8bit)
```



## IR[28h.R] - LSR - Line Status Register (R)


```
  7    FIFO data error (0=None, 1=At least one Error/Break anywhere in RX FIFO)
  6    THR and TSR empty   (0=Not empty, 1=Empty)  (TX FIFO and TX shift reg)
  5    THR empty           (0=Not empty, 1=Empty)  (TX FIFO)
  4    Break interrupt     (0=No, 1=Break, next RX FIFO char reads as 00h)
  3    Framing Error       (0=No, 1=Error; bad stop bit in data from RX FIFO)
  2    Parity Error        (0=No, 1=Error; in data being read from RX FIFO)
  1    Overrun Error       (0=No, 1=Error; overrun has occurred)
  0    Data in Receiver    (0=No, 1=At least one character in the RX FIFO)
```

Bit2-4 reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the top of the
RX FIFO (next character to be read). Therefore, errors in a character are
identified by reading the LSR and then reading the RHR.



## IR[20h] - MCR - Modem Control Register (R/W)

  4    Enable Loopback  (0=Normal, 1=local Loopback mode, internal)
        In this mode the MCR[1:0] signals are looped back into MSR[4:5] and
        the TX output is looped back to the RX input internally.

  0    DTR output (GPIO5) (if IOControl.bit1=1) (0=High/Inactive, 1=Low/Active)
        Writing to IOState bit 5 will not have any effect on this pin.
```

Bit2,5-7 can only be modified when EFR[4] is set, ie. EFR[4] is a write enable.

Bit0: Only available on SC16IS750/SC16IS760.

```

Bit1-3,5-7: Only available on SC16IS750/SC16IS760.

Remark: The primary inputs RI, CD, CTS, DSR are all active LOW.

Reading IOState bit 6,6,4 does not reflect the true state of CD,RI,DSR pin, uh?



## IR[08h] - IER - Interrupt Enable Register (R/W)


```
  7    CTS change interrupt enable          (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  6    RTS change interrupt enable          (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  5    Xoff received interrupt              (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  4    Sleep mode                           (0=Disable, 1=Sleep Mode)
  3    Modem Status Interrupt               (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  2    Receive Line Status error interrupt  (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  1    Transmit Holding Register interrupt  (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  0    Receive Holding Register interrupt   (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
```

Bit4-7 can only be modified if EFR[4] is set, that is, EFR[4] is a write
enable. Re-enabling IER[1] will not cause a new interrupt if the THR is below
the threshold.

Bit3: Only available on the SC16IS750/SC16IS760.

Bit3: See IOControl.bit1 for the description of how to program the pins as
modem pins.



## IR[10h.R] - IIR - Interrupt Identification Register (R)


```
  7    Mirror of FCR.bit0: RX/TX FIFO enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable) ;\both same
  6    Mirror of FCR.bit0: RX/TX FIFO enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable) ;/
  5-1  Interrupt source (5bit encoded, see below) (valid when bit0=0)
  0    Interrupt status (0=IRQ pending, 1=No IRQ pending)
```

Interrupt sources:

```
  Src Prio Expl.
  03h 1    Receiver Line Status error
  06h 2    Receiver time-out interrupt
  02h 2    RHR interrupt
  01h 3    THR interrupt
  00h 4    MSR Modem interrupt           (SC16IS750/SC16IS760 only)
  18h 5    IOState GPIO input pin change (SC16IS750/SC16IS760 only)
  08h 6    received Xoff signal/special character
  10h 7    CTS, RTS change state from active(LOW) to inactive(HIGH)
```

Burst reads on the serial interface should not be performed on the IIR register
(ie. don't read multiple elements on the I2C-bus without a STOP or repeated
START condition, and don't read multiple elements on the SPI bus without
de-asserting the CS pin).



## IR[10h.LCR=BFh] - EFR - Enhanced Features Register (R/W)


```
  7    CTS flow control enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable; stop TX upon CTS=HIGH)
  6    RTS flow control enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable; change RTS upon TCR)
         RTS pin goes HIGH when RX FIFO halt trigger level TCR[3:0] is reached
         RTS pin goes LOW when RX FIFO resume trigger level TCR[7:4] is reached
  5    Special character detect (0=Disable, 1=Enable, compare with Xoff2)
         If a Xoff2 match occurs, the received data is transferred to FIFO and
         IIR.bit4 is set to 1 to indicate a special character has been detected
  4    Enhanced functions enable bit (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
         Enables writing to IER[7:4], FCR[5:4], MCR[7:5]
  3-0  Combinations of software flow control can be selected by programming
         these bits. See Table 3 "Software flow control options (EFR[3:0])".
```



## IR[00h.DLAB=1] - DLL - Baudrate Divisor Latch Register Low, bit0-7 (R/W)



## IR[08h.DLAB=1] - DLH - Baudrate Divisor Latch Register High, bit8-15 (R/W)


```
  15-0  16bit divisor for generation of the clock in the baudrate generator
```

Remark: DLL and DLH can only be written to before Sleep mode is enabled, that
is, before IER[4] is set.



## IR[30h.MCR[2]=1 and EFR[4]=1] - TCR - Transmission Control Register (R/W)


```
  7-4  RX FIFO flow control resume trigger level  (N*4) (0..14 = 0..56 chars)
  3-0  RX FIFO flow control halt trigger level    (N*4) (1..15 = 4..60 chars)
```

RX FIFO threshold levels to stop/start transmission during hardware/software
flow control (ie. for RTS pin, or Xon/Xoff chars).

Remark: TCR can only be written to when EFR[4]=1 and MCR[2]=1.

The programmer must program the TCR such that Halt>Resume, aka
TCR[3:0]>TCR[7:4]. There is no built-in hardware check to make sure this
condition is met.

Also, the TCR must be programmed with this condition before auto RTS or
software flow control is enabled to avoid spurious operation of the device.



## IR[38h.MCR[2]=1 and EFR[4]=1] - TLR - Trigger Level Register (R/W)


```
  7-4  RX FIFO interrupt trigger level (N*4) (1..15 = 4..60 chars available)
  3-0  TX FIFO interrupt trigger level (N*4) (1..15 = 4..60 spaces available)
```

Remark: TLR can only be written to when EFR[4]=1 and MCR[2]=1. If TLR[3:0] or
TLR[7:4] are logical 0, the selectable trigger levels via the FIFO Control
Register (FCR) are used for the transmit and receive FIFO trigger levels.
Trigger levels from 4 characters to 60 characters are available with a
granularity of four. The TLR should be programmed for NÏ4, where N is the
desired trigger level.

When the trigger level setting in TLR is zero, the SC16IS740/750/760 uses the
trigger level setting defined in FCR. If TLR has non-zero trigger level value,
the trigger level defined in FCR is discarded. This applies to both transmit
FIFO and receive FIFO trigger level setting.

When TLR is used for RX trigger level control, FCR[7:6] should be left at the
default state, that is, '00'.



## IR[40h.R] - TXLVL - Transmitter FIFO Level register (R)


```
  7    Unused (0)
  6-0  Number of spaces available in TX FIFO (00h..40h; 00h=Full, 40h=Empty)
```



## IR[48h.R] - RXLVL - Receiver FIFO Level register (R)


```
  7    Unused (0)
  6-0  Number of characters stored in RX FIFO (00h..40h; 00h=Empty, 40h=Full)
```



## IR[50h] - IODir - Programmable I/O pins Direction register (R/W)


This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760.

```
  7-0  IODir set GPIO pins [7:0] to input or output (0=Input, 1=Output)
```

Remark: If there is a pending input (GPIO) interrupt and IODir is written, this
pending interrupt will be cleared, that is, the interrupt signal will be
negated.



## IR[58h] - IOState - Programmable I/O pins State Register (R/W)


```
  7-0  IOState Write this register: set the logic level on the output pins
          0=set output pin to zero
          1=set output pin to one
        Read this register: return states of all pins
```

This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760.

When read, this register returns the actual state of all I/O pins.

When write, each register bit will be transferred to the corresponding IO pin
programmed as output.



## IR[60h] - IOIntEna - I/O Interrupt Enable Register (R/W)


```
  7-0  Input change interrupt enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
```

This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760.

This register enables the interrupt due to a change in the I/O configured as
inputs. If GPIO[7:4] are programmed as modem pins, their interrupt generation
must be enabled via IER register bit3. In this case bit4-7  of IOIntEna will
have no effect on GPIO[7:4].



## IR[70h] - IOControl - I/O Control register (R/W)


```
  7-4  Reserved
  3    Software reset (0=No change, 1=Reset)                    (W)
  2    Reserved
  1    Use GPIO[7:4] as GPIO or as modem pins (0=GPIO, 1=RI,CD,DTR,DSR)
  0    IOLATCH enable/disable inputs latching
        0 = input values are not latched. A change in any input generates an
         interrupt. A read of the input register clears the interrupt. If the
         input goes back to its initial logic state before the input register
         is read, then the interrupt is cleared.
        1 = input values are latched. A change in the input generates an
         interrupt and the input logic value is loaded in the bit of the
         corresponding input state register (IOState). A read of the IOState
         register clears the interrupt. If the input pin goes back to its
         initial logic state before the interrupt register is read, then the
         interrupt is not cleared and the corresponding bit of the IOState
         register keeps the logic value that initiates the interrupt.
```

This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760.

Remark: As I/O pins, the direction, state, and interrupt of GPIO4 to GPIO7 are
controlled by the following registers: IODir, IOState, IOIntEna, and IOControl.
The state of CD, RI, DSR pins will not be reflected in MSR[7:5] or MSR[3:1],
and any change of state on these three pins will not trigger a modem status
interrupt (even if enabled via IER[3]), and the state of the DTR pin cannot be
controlled by MCR[0].

As modem CD, RI, DSR pins, the status at the input of these three pins can be
read from MSR[7:5] and MSR[3:1], and the state of DTR pin can be controlled by
MCR[0]. Also, if modem status interrupt bit is enabled, IER[3], a change of
state of RI, CD, DSR pins will trigger a modem interrupt. Bit[7:4] of the
IODir, IOState, and IOIntEna registers will not have any effect on these three
pins.



## IR[78h] - EFCR - Extra Features Control Register (R/W)

  4    Enable the transmitter to control the RTS pin (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  3    Reserved
  2    Disable transmitter  (0=Normal, 1=Disable; stop forwarding THR to TSR)
        UART does not send serial data out on the transmit pin, but the
        transmit FIFO will continue to receive data from host until full.
        Any data in the TSR will be sent out before the transmitter goes into
        disable state.
  1    Disable receiver     (0=Normal, 1=Disable)
        UART will stop receiving data immediately once this bit set to 1, and
        any data in the TSR?? will be sent to the receive FIFO.
        User is advised not to set this bit during receiving.
  0    Enable 9bit or Multidrop mode  (0=Normal RS-232, 1=Enable RS-485)

## Infrared Usage in 3DS


The 3DS doesn't have any expansion connector, and it's instead using the IrDA
port for expansion hardware (with external batteries):

- - Circle Pad Pro (a second Circle Pad, attached right of the A/B/X/Y buttons)
- - NFC Near-field communication (for Amiibo figures)

For the NFC thing, see here:

- [3DS NFC Adapter](#3dsnfcadapter)
That add-on hardware exists for Old3DS only. The New3DS does have equivalent
hardware built-in, and thus doesn't need that add-ons.

The IrDA port could theoretically communicate with old NDS pedometers (Activity
Meter and P-Walker), there isn't any known 3DS software supporting that though
(and the 3DS has its own pedometer built-in anyways, although it's a bit clumsy
to carry the whole console).

Additionally, IrDA could be reportedly used for things like file transfers,
unknown if there are 3DS tools supporting such things?



## Infrared Signals


The SC16IS750 UART/IrDA SIR datasheet does mainly describe the UART part, and
barely mentions infrared at all (apart from saying that the chip is IrDA SIR
compatible, and that IrDA can be enabled in MCR.bit6).

Going by other sources, IrDA SIR works like "UART over infrared". In lack of
further details, here some guesses on how it might work (and how far it is (or
isn't) compatible with regular cable-based UARTs):

- - RX/TX are probably using pulsed signals instead of constant LOW/HIGH levels?
- - RTS/CTS/DTR/DSR are probably not implemented at all?
- - Simultaneous RX+TX might work in opposite light-direction, if no reflection?
- - Infrared interruptions and noise may require additional error checking?
- - Infrared at less than 10mm (as in Circle Pad Pro) may work 100% error-free?



## Infrared Protocol


Specifications for the IrDA standard aren't available for free, and there's
little known about the protocol:

- - IrDA protocol supports file transfers from one device to another
- - IrDA protocol must include some sort of packet headers and checksums
- - And probably much stuff

However, it's unknown if Nintendo did bother to follow the IrDA standard in
their Circle Pad Pro and NFC add-ons. It's also possible that they have just
used a custom UART-like transfer protocol for that hardware.



## Infrared Range


IrDA is supposed for short-range transfers (about 20cm - 100cm) in binary
format. As such, it isn't intended to use the hardware for things like classic
TV remote controls (although... maybe it could be tweaked to output TV remote
signals on TX pin... possibly in UART mode with IrDA disabled?).

## I2C Bus/Device 1:2Eh - Lower LCD screen (lcd1)


LCD controllers for top/bottom screen.



## I2C Access


I2C writing works as for most other I2C chips:

```
  I2cWriteCmd (Device+0, Index, Data)
```

However, I2C reading works uncommon:

```
  I2cWriteCmd (Device+0, 40h, ReadIndex)
  I2cReadCmd  (Device+1, ReadIndex, Data)
```

Ie. the LCD chips distinguish between WriteIndex and ReadIndex, with the
ReadIndex being set by writing to register 40h. The ReadIndex value in the
response can be ignored (or verified to be same as the written ReadIndex
value).

# <a name="3dsi2cnew3dsnearfieldcommunicationnfc"></a>3DS I2C New3DS Near-Field Communication (NFC)




## I2C Bus/Device 1:EEh - Near-Field Communication (NFC) (New3DS-only)


This device is transferring command/response packets on the I2C bus (so one
must only transfer Device+Data bytes; without any register Index values).



## Datasheets and Specs


The NFC controller appears to be a 32pin Broadcom BCM20791 chip, there is no
datasheet for that chip, however, a datasheet for 34pin BCM20793S chip does
exist, but unfortunately without any specs on the transfer protocol.

Specifications for the lower-level transfer protocol (and maybe even the I2C
bus protocol?) are made by the "NFC Forum" (a non-profit organization that
charges lots of money for a copy of those specs).

There is some android open source code for "bcm2079x" available.



## New3DS Transfer Protocol...


Command request / response structure:

```
  00h 1     Normally 10h?
  01h 1     Command source / destination
  02h 1     CmdID
  03h 1     Payload size (LEN)
  04h LEN   Data/parameters
```


The command response payload is usually at least 1-byte, where that byte
appears to be normally 00h. For command requests the payload data is the
command parameters.


For command requests sent to the NFC tag itself, Cmd[1]=0x0 and CmdID=0x0. The
command request payload data here is the actual command request data for the
NFC tag, starting with the CmdID u8 at payload+0.


During NFC module startup, a certain command (?) is sent to the controller
which eventually (after various cmd-reply headers etc) returns the following
after the first byte in the payload:

```
  000000: 44 65 63 20 32 32 20 32 30 31 32 31 34 3a 35 33  Dec 22 201214:53
  000010: 3a 35 30 01 05 0d 46 05 1b 79 20 07 32 30 37 39  :50...F..y .2079
  000020: 31 42 35                                         1B5
```

Or that is: "Dec 22 201214:53:50\<binary>20791B5". Therefore, this appears
to return the part-number of the NFC controller (other command request(s) /
response(s) use this part-number value too).

Actually, 20791B5 seems to be NFC certification number for an unspecified
Broadcom product (or possibly 20791B5 is the product name itself... yes,
apparently it's Broadcom BCM20791).

Protocol = NFC Forum NFC Controller Interface (NCI) for host interface



## NFC controller commands


```
  CmdRequest[1, uh?]  CmdID   Payload data for parameters
  2Eh                 2Fh     Firmware image for this chunk, size varies.
```

This is used during NFC module startup to upload the firmware image to the NFC
controller. This is used repeatedly to upload multiple chunks of the image.



## Power-up


After power-up, the NFC chip automatically sends these bytes upon I2C reads:

```
  10 60 00 02 00 01     ;followed by endless FF bytes
```

That seems to be a 4-byte header, with 2-byte data, as indicated in hdr[3]=02h.



## NFC Interrupt


Triggers when there is data available for reading. Unknown if there is also a
way for determining if the thing is ready for writing a new command... maybe
one should simply wait for a response packet after sending any command packets?



## Old3DS Version


The Old3DS did have an external NFC Adapter add-on, accessed via IrDA.

- [3DS NFC Adapter](#3dsnfcadapter)
The 3DS OS is supposedly having backwards/forwards compatible NFC functions,
but the underlying transfer protocol seems to be completely different (relying
on IrDA to communicate with the adpater firmare, instead of directly accessing
the BCM20791 chip).




# <a name="3dsnfcadapter"></a>3DS NFC Adapter



The Nintendo NFC adapter, formally Nintendo NFC Reader/Writer and codenamed
Fangate, is an external device which adds NFC capabilities for amiibos to old
Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo 2DS consoles, using the infrared port on the back of
the console.


It launched simultaneously with Animal Crossing Happy Home Designer, with which
it's optionally bundled; it can also be bought standalone at a nominal(?) price
of 21 EUR.



## Technical details


Based on analysis of the fangate\_updater.bin file, which is part of the old
Nintendo 3DS operating system since 9.3.0-21 and contains the firmware running
on the external adapter; and analysis of the NFC Services running on old 3DS.

```

                            is that guessed from fangate_updater.bin,

  - 03h   N  Payload
  - 03h+N 1  CRC-8-CCITT for whole packet [00h..N+02h]  ;uh, before/after XORing?
- IR framing format - long frame (max 3FFFh data bytes):
  - 00h   1  Synchronization byte (A5h)
  - 01h   1  Reserved for future use (???)
  - 02h   1  bit7:RFU (0), bit6:Long frame (1), bit0-5: Payload size upper bits
  - 03h   1  Payload size (lower 8 bits)
  - 04h   N  Payload (XOR-encrypted)
  - 04h+N 1  CRC-8-CCITT for whole packet [00h..N+03h]  ;uh, before/after XORing?

The payload is encrypted using a XOR-based encryption:

```
    halfCount = size/2          ;Divide by 2 rounding towards zero
    xorval = htobe16(0xE963)    ;that is, BIG-ENDIAN ?
    for (i = 0; i < halfCount; i++)
      xorval = xorval XOR = src[i]
      dst[i] = xorval
```



## Layer 2 - "ircom"


ircom is a simple stateful point-to-point master-slave communication protocol
built on top of IR layer 1.

```
  00h 4   Random (makes the whole packet look random after XOR encryption)
  04h 1   bit4-7:RFU?, bit0-3:Protocol version (01h)
  05h 1   Connection ID of master (3DS), value determined by master
  06h 1   Connection ID of slave (NFC adapter), value determined by slave
  07h 1   bit4-7:???, bit0-3: Operation code
  08h N-8 Payload (if any)
```

Operation codes:

```
  Code  Name                          Has payload     Direction
  00h = Layer 3 command               Yes             Master to slave
  01h = ???
  02h = ???
  03h = ???
  04h = ???
  05h = ???
  06h = ???
  07h = ???
  08h = ???
  09h = ???
  0Ah = Disconnect request            No              Master to slave
  0Bh = Disconnection acknowledgment  No              Slave to master
  0Ch = Handshake                     No              Master to slave
  0Dh = Handshake acknowledgement     No              Slave to master
  0Eh = ???
  0Fh = ???
```

NFC adapter will ignore packets whose protocol version is not 1. It will not
even reply.

Connection identifier is a random byte the 3DS assigns to identify the
connection should there be several connections in range at once. Slave devices
must save this value from the initial handshake packet and use it for replies.
The 3DS will also save the connection identifier byte of the slave which is
also random. The 3DS must also ignore packets whose connection ID does not
match.



## Layer 3


Layer 3 is the payload of layer 2. A lot is unknown of this layer and thus a
lot of assumptions were made in the following tables.


Layer 3 contains the following data:

```
  00h    bit4-7:Request identifier nibble, bit0-3: Always 01h
  01h    Slave/master identifier byte
  02h    Request type code upper byte
  03h    Request type code lower byte
  04h+   Payload (if any)
```


Request identifier nibble is incremented by 0x1 at every new request by the
master, the same value for this byte is also sent by the slave in response to
the request of the master

Slave/master identifier byte is 0x1 for a message from the master and 0x10 for
a message from the slave



## Request type codes


```
  Code    Request description                           Direction   Has payload
  0000h = ACK                                           Slave to master  Yes
  0003h = Get firmware version and battery level        Master to slave  No
  0004h = Firmware version and battery level            Slave to master  Yes
  0100h = Unknown, slave always responds with ACK       Master to slave  Yes
  0202h = Request to stop communication with NFC tag    Master to slave  No
  0204h = Get dumped data from NFC tag                  Master to slave  No
  0205h = Data from NFC tag                             Slave to master  Yes
  0206h = Request to start communication with NFC tag   Master to slave  Yes
  0207h = Request to write data to NFC tag              Master to slave  Yes
```



## 0000h


Acknowledgement message always send by slave. Payload always contains
000000AAh.



## 0004h


Payload contains firmware version and battery level of NFC adapter. Payload has
a size of 6 bytes.

```
  00h    Upper or lower byte of version number, newest firmware is 01h
  01h    Upper or lower byte of version number, newest firmware is 06h
  02h    Padding byte? Always 00h
  03h    Padding byte? Always 00h
  04h    Battery level (03h=Full, 00h=Empty)
  05h    Padding byte? Always 00h
```

NFC reader LED already turns red when the battery level byte is 02h, this will
also trigger a low battery level warning on the 3DS.



## 0100h


The purpose of this request by the master is unknown. Slave always responds
with ACK. Payload of this request is always 0003E8AAh.



## 0205h


Payload contains data regarding NFC communication. The first byte of the
payload means the following:

```
  Code   Description
  00h =  NFC communication is stopped as result of a 0202h request from master
  01h =  No NFC tag on top of the reader
  02h =  Busy dumping NFC tag
  03h =  NFC tag dump after write by master
  04h =  NFC tag fully dumped
  05h =  NFC tag dump after write by master
  07h =  NFC tag not a NTAG215 or contains no Amiibo compatible data
  08h =  NFC tag removed from reader
```

After the tag is written by the master and dumped again, the first few dumps
start with 03h, this changes to 05h after a few dumps. The reason for this is
unknown.



## 0206h


Request from master to start NFC communication. Payload always contains 19 00h
padding bytes, followed by C80300393A737486000001h and another 26 00h padding
bytes.



## 0207h


Request from master to write to NFC tag. The request packet already contains
the desired data to be written to the tag. Payload start with two 00h padding
bytes followed by the 7 ID bytes of the tag. These ID bytes are used by the NFC
adapter to check if same Amiibo is placed on the NFC adapter again.

# <a name="3dsi2cnew3dscstickandzlzrbuttons"></a>3DS I2C New3DS C-Stick and ZL/ZR-Buttons




## I2C Bus/Device 2:54h - C-Stick and ZL/ZR-Buttons


This is a New3DS-only device (the Old3DS does have a similar add-on: Circle Pad
Pro, connected to the infrared expansion port).

Oberseve that the bootrom doesn't initialized I2C\_BUS2\_CNTEX/SCL (especially
CNTEX is required to have "Wait if SCL held low" enabled, else the C-stick
replies are garbage).

The chip triggers ARM11 IRQ 68h (aka GPIO\_DATA3.bit0=0) when moving the analog
input or buttons. Reading the I2C data changes GPIO back to bit0=1.

Maybe this is the HUGE 44pin HF374 chip on button board, but if it's merely
used for ZL/ZR and C-stick, why is that chip so huge?



## I2C Read(Device+1,Byte0,Byte1,Byte2,Byte3,...)


Reading returns some kind of array, always starting with the status value in
byte0, there is no need to write an index value before reading.

The array has useful info stored in first 4-7 bytes; and internal/garbage when
reading further bytes, up to including something that looks like a CPU stack).

- The array entries are...
  - 00h       Status byte (80h..83h, or FFh) (power-up default=80h)
  - 01h       Button byte (00h=None, bit2=ZL, ?=ZR)
  - 02h       Analog X (00h=Center, -1xh=Left, +1xh=Right) ;\if enabled
  - 03h       Analog Y (00h=Center, -1xh=Down, +1xh=Up)    ;/
- Following bytes aren't needed, except for better 8bit X/Y resolution...
  - 04h       Fixed FFh
  - 05h       Analog X (00h=Center, -7xh=Left, +7xh=Right) ;\hires
  - 06h       Analog Y (00h=Center, -7xh=Down, +7xh=Up)    ;/
- Following bytes aren't actually useful...
  - 07h       Fixed 00h
  - 08h       Analog X (7xh=Center, FEh=Left, 00h=Right)   ;\unsigned/uncentered

  - 0Ah       Fixed 00h
  - 0Bh       Analog X (7xh=Center, FEh=Left, 00h=Right)   ;\same as [08h,09h]
  - 0Ch       Analog Y (7xh=Center, FEh=Down, 00h=Up)      ;/
  - 0Dh       Fixed 00h
  - 0Eh       Center X (7xh)  ;\auto-calibrating, with minor changes
  - 0Fh       Center Y (7xh)  ;/every some seconds
  - 10h       Fixed 00h
  - 11h..15h  Analog stuff
  - 16h       Flag (00h=Idle, 80h=Analog is/was recently touched)
  - 17h       Analog stuff
  - 18h       Flag (01h=Idle, 02h=Analog is/was recently left or down)
  - 19h       Analog stuff
- Following bytes can crash the chip upon reading (see below for details):
  - 1Ah       Flag (01h=Idle, 00h/02h=Analog is/was recently somehow moved)
  - 1Bh       Fixed 01h
  - 1Ch       Fixed 11h

  - 4Ch       Whatever, changes
  - 4Dh       Flag (00h=Idle, 01h=Analog is/was recently moved)
  - 4Eh..54h  Fixed 01h,00h,06h,01h,A5h,00h,00h
  - 55h       Initially random xxh, becomes 00h/01h after button/analog
  - 56h       Flag 00h/10h/20h
  - 57h       Analog X (00h=Center, -1xh=Left, +1xh=Right) ;\same as [02h,03h]
  - 58h       Analog Y (00h=Center, -1xh=Down, +1xh=Up)    ;/
  - 59h       Analog
  - 5Ah       Analog
  - 5Bh..65h  Fixed 07h,00h,08h,04h,00h,00h,00h,09h,22h,71h,00h
  - 66h       Fast Timer (00h..1xh or so)
  - 67h       Fixed 15h ;maybe update period in ms, maybe limit for above timer?
  - 68h       Slow Timer (00h..08h, increasing)
  - 69h..6Ch  Fixed 09h,03h,00h,00h         ;maybe 09h is limit for above timer?
  - 6Dh       Up/down Timer (00h=Idle, increases-then-decreases upon analog move)
  - 6Eh..6Fh  Fixed 00h,00h
  - 70h       Button byte (00h=None, bit4=ZL, ?=ZR)
  - 71h       Usually 00h (sometimes shortly 10h or so)
  - 72h..74h  Fixed 00h-filled
  - 75h       Fixed FFh
  - 76h..7Bh  Fixed 00h-filled
  - 7Ch..82h  Fixed 7Fh,15h,09h,03h,54h,28h,10h
  - 83h..BDh  Fixed 00h-filled
- Following bytes might be CPU stack, first some bytes maybe random/garbage?
  - BEh       7Ah,02h,1Dh,D9h,C7h,93h,31h,CCh,7Eh,A9h,BEh,86h,B3h,93h,6Dh,07h
  - CEh       C7h,82h,E7h,00h,10h,00h,00h,10h,00h,10h,00h,10h,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh
  - DEh       xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh,xxh
- Following bytes seem to be used...
  - EEh..xxxx Fixed FFh-filled (somewhat endless repeating)

Caution: The chip hangs after some seconds when reading more than 1Ah bytes; at
that point all values get frozen (except, the "stack" at DDh..EDh does keep
changing).



## I2C Write(Device,Mode)


Writing does set a mode value, eg. write(Device,Mode). There is no need to
write anything, the analog input and irq are automatically enabled on power-up.
Effects for different mode values are:

```
  None      Default is Status=80h at power-up
  00h..51h  Set Status=80h
  52h..F4h  Set Status=81h
  F5h       Set Status=82h
  F6h..F9h  Set Status=83h
  FAh..FBh  Set Status=81h
  FCh..FDh  Set Status=FFh
  FEh       Set Status=80h with long 1 second I2C-clk-hold delay?
  FFh       Set Status=80h
```

Unknown what those mode/status values are meaning exactly. Maybe some can
change polling interval or enable/disable interrupts, or maybe even do
dangerous stuff like reflashing the firmware?

Some of the mode values disable the Analog bytes at index 02h/03h (causing that
bytes to become always 00h, or maybe actually divide them by a large value,
causing them to be always NEAR 00h?)

Trying to write more bytes (eg. write(Device,xx,yy) seems to apply the last
written byte as mode value.



## Operating System


The 3DS OS does access the C-stick via IR:RST service (probably for backwards
compatibility with Circle Pad Pro, which was accessed via infrared).

The OS can reportedly change the update period in range of 10..21ms (aka
0Ah..15h), maybe via whatever I2C write.

The OS does reportedly return analog values in range -9Ch..+9Ch, maybe that are
the I2C values scaled for Circle Pad Pro compatibility, or maybe a sum of
multiple I2C values?

## Port Usage in New3DS


Unknown. The IO Expander chip is close to the top-screen connectors, as such it
does probably connect to components in the top-screen unit (which might include
upper camera; or reportedly-existing head-tracking related stuff).

Unknown how a 16bit IO could do head-tracking, maybe it does opposite: receive
the tracking RESULT from ARM side, and then OUTPUT something to parallax
barrier?

Unknown if this can be reverse-engineered by people with broken top-screen
connectors. Note: Below "usually set/cleared" assumes that the connector for
upper backlight is broken, unknown if an intact console behaves the same.

## Device 7 (Bus/device 1:40h) "i2c::DEB" Debug?



## Device 8 (Bus/device 1:44h) "i2c::DEB" Debug?


Unknown.



## Device 9 (Bus/device 2:A6h/D6h) "i2c::HID" Debug??


Unknown.

Device Address changed from A6h to D6h in 8.0.0-18.



## Device 12 (Bus/device 2:A4h) "DebugPad"


```
  Register   Width   Description
  00h        21      DebugPad state.
```

This is the DebugPad device, see here.



## Device 14 (Bus/device 2:A0h) "eeprom?"


Used by Cfg-sysmodule via the i2c::EEP service. This is presumably EEPROM going
by the service name.

The Cfg-module code which loads the CCAL (nandro:/sys/{HWCAL0.dat/HWCAL1.dat})
file from NAND will load it from I2C instead, if a certain state flag is
non-zero. Likewise for the function which writes CCAL to NAND. HMAC/hash
verification after loading is skipped when the CCAL was loaded from I2C.



## Bus/device 0:00h-0Eh - Mirrors to BPTWL for whatever reason



## Bus/device 0:F0h-FEh - Mirrors to BPTWL for whatever reason


These are special broadcast/reserved device ids (defined in I2C protocol). The
MCU chip apparently includes a hardware feature for decoding these IDs; and
accidentally mirrors the BPTWL registers to them.



## Bus/device 2:00h - Unknown, something responds here with ACK and FFh's


This is a special broadcast address (defined in I2C protocol). One (or more) of
the devices on I2C Bus 2 do apparently respond to it... and perhaps even
support some broadcast commands?

## LCD Registers


These registers are used to configure the LCD screens.

- [3DS Video LCD Registers](#3dsvideolcdregisters)
Moreover, each screen is having an I2C-bus controller for further
configuration.

- [3DS I2C LCD Screen Controllers](#3dsi2clcdscreencontrollers)
And, the MCU has several LCD/backlight enable flags... and a GPU flag?

# <a name="3dsvideolcdregisters"></a>3DS Video LCD Registers



This seems to be an interface between GPU video output and actual LCD screens.
The registers allow to control backlight brightness and to set a forced blank
color. Some other registers seem to be also affect backlight brightness (or
pixel brightness?); and maybe some do affect internal voltages or internal
backlight PWM timings?


The bootrom error screen initializes only a few of these registers (and leaves
the others at their power-up defaults). Many of the uninitialized registers
seem to have no effect on the visible picture, even when setting/clearing all
bits; some of them affect the brightness of the pixels or backlight (but only
if CtrlFlags.bit0=1).

The bootrom error screen has some complicated function that initializes this
array with scaled/interpolated values, somehow related to backlight level and
screen type; although, with the used parameters... it seems to be just settings
all 100h table entries to the same value.

Alongsides, the number of leading entries with SAME value should be stored in
register 10202238h/10202A38h (ie. store N-1 if the first N table entries are
all same).

Apart from VRAM, the GPU can also access other memory like FCRAM, AXI, QTM (but
that's most probably slower; and may be problematic when using virtual memory
allocation on ARM11 side).

# <a name="3dsgpuexternalregistersmemorycontrolstatusregisters"></a>3DS GPU External Registers - Memory Control/Status Registers



The 3DS bootrom error screen initializes only 10400004h and 10400030h (VRAM
control/power). The 3DS OS does reportedly also initialize 10400050h and
10400054h (timings?).



## 10400000h - GPU\_FIXED\_00010002h (always 00010002h, maybe ChipID/Version) (R)


```
  0-31  Always 00010002h (maybe ChipID/Version)
```

Note: Register 104010D4h seems to contain the same readonly value.



## 10400004h - GPU\_VRAM\_CNT (reset=0, bootrom=300h) (R/W)


```
  0-31  Unknown (0..FFFFFFFFh)
```

Seems to have no effect on LCD output. However, value FFFFFFFFh does mess up
the polygon renderer (or MEMCOPY unit), causing each 4 scanlines to be drawn
twice.



## 10400008h - GPU\_UNKNOWN\_2BIT (reset=0) (R/W)


```
  0-1   Unknown (0..03h)
  2-31  Unused (0)
```



## 10400030h - GPU\_VRAM\_POWER (R/W)


```
  0-7   Unknown (0..FFh)
  8     Power off VRAM_A data.bit0-63   (0=On, 1=Power Off)
  9     Power off VRAM_A data.bit64-127 (0=On, 1=Power Off)
  10    Power off VRAM_B data.bit0-63   (0=On, 1=Power Off) ;\later uses VRAM_A
  11    Power off VRAM_B data.bit64-127 (0=On, 1=Power Off) ;/when VRAM_B=off?
  12-31 Unknown (0..FFFFFh)
```

Seems to disable VRAM power, VRAM\_A/B are 3Mbyte each, and each of them seems
to have separate sections for data bit0-63 and 64-127 (ie. the first and second
8 bytes within 16 byte snippets).

After writing to 10400030h, one should issue a dummy read from 10400030h.

Even when disabled only for a short moment, the VRAM does immediately forget
it's data and gets filled with random values; this can be seen after
re-enabling the memory (the CPU hangs when reading VRAM while it is disabled).



## 10400034h - GPU\_STAT\_IRQ\_FLAGS (R)


Contains IRQ flags (normally IRQ handling/polling should work fine without
needing this register; except, polling GPU\_MEMCOPY\_CNT can apparently hang the
CPU, whilst polling GPU\_STAT\_IRQ\_FLAGS.bit30 does work better).

```
  0     Unknown, usually set ;\get cleared when setting GPU_MAKE_SOMETHING.bit0
  1     Unknown, usually set ;/(unknown if/when the flags can get set again)
  2-25  Unused (0)
  26    IRQ 28h PSC0 aka GPU_MEMFILL 0 ready ;mirror of GPU_MEMFILL_CNT0.bit1
  27    IRQ 29h PSC1 aka GPU_MEMFILL 1 ready ;mirror of GPU_MEMFILL_CNT1.bit1
  28    IRQ 2Ah PDC0 aka GPU H/V-IRQ for top screen
  29    IRQ 2Bh PDC1 aka GPU H/V-IRQ for bottom screen
  30    IRQ 2Ch PPF  aka GPU_MEMCOPY ready   ;mirror of GPU_MEMCOPY_CNT.bit8
  31    IRQ 2Dh P3D  aka GPUREG_IRQ_CMP/REQ match (commonly at end of cmdlist)
```

Bit26,27,30 can be cleared in the corresponding mirrored registers.

Bit28,29 are automatically set/cleared during LCD output (usually once per
frame).

Bit31 can be cleared by setting IRQ\_REQ and IRQ\_CMP to different values.



## 10400038h - GPU\_STAT\_SOMETHING (R)


```
  0-31  Can be 00000000h, 10400800h, 10402000h, or 10410000h
```

Unknown, initially 10402000h on reset, 10400800h after LCD init or so, and
becomes 00000000h after setting GPU\_MAKE\_SOMETHING.bit0, and (thereafter?)
changes to 10410000h. No idea if 104xxxxxh is related to the address of the GPU
I/O area.



## 1040003Ch - GPU\_MAKE\_SOMETHING (R/W)


```
  0     Unknown (0=Normal, 1=GPU_STAT_SOMETHING changes after a while)
  1-31  Unknown (0..7FFFFFFFh)
```

Unknown, setting bit0 (even only for a short moment) will later on cause
GPU\_STAT\_SOMETHING to become 10410000h. Also affects GPU\_STAT\_IRQ\_FLAGS.bit0-1.



## 10400040h - GPU\_STAT\_BACKLIGHT\_OR\_SO (R)


```
  0-1   Unknown (usually 0, but can be 3 when [104000C0h]=0 or [104000CCh]=0)
  2-31  Unused (0)
```



## 10400044h - GPU\_UNKNOWN\_CAN\_BE\_7F80h (R)


```
  0-31  Texture related...? (usually 0, but sometimes 7F80h, and once 1200h)
```

Unknown. Usually zero, but can contain other values after rendering with
GPUREG\_TEXUNIT\_CONFIG=nonzero (even then, it does often stay zero, but
sometimes changes to 7F80h, and once changed to 1200h). Whether the register
does change seems to depend on power-up state of other uninitialized
registers/memory and/or whatever timings (if nonzero values did occur then they
do usually reappear upon next rendering even after reset, but that behaviour
can change on next power-up).

Note: Value 1200h occurred after changing GPUREG\_COLORBUFFER\_LOC and
GPUREG\_DEPTHBUFFER\_LOC to dummy address zero (but that couldn't be reproduced).



## 10400048h - GPU\_UNKNOWN\_32BIT (reset=0) (R/W)


```
  0-31  Unknown (0..FFFFFFFFh)
```



## 10400050h - GPU\_TIMING\_CNT1 (R/W=FFFFFFFFh) (res=1111EF00h) ;init=22221200h


```
  0-31  Unknown (0..FFFFFFFFh) (affects GPU_MEMCOPY timings and maybe others)
```

Somehow affects timings. Different values can make timings about 10% faster or
slower (or, some values seem to make no difference at all). For example,

```
  10101010h or 20202020h --> slower MEMCOPY
  1111EF00h or 22221200h --> normal MEMCOPY
  FFFFFFFFh              --> faster MEMCOPY
```



## 10400054h - GPU\_TIMING\_CNT2 (R/W=FFFFFFFFh) (res=00000112h) ;init=00000FF2h


```
  0-31  Unknown (0..FFFFFFFFh) (probably affects whatever timings)
```



## 10400058h - GPU\_STAT\_BUSY\_FLAGS (R)


```
  10    Unknown, seems to be set on power-up, but later cleared?
  17    Often set after writing GPU_VRAM_POWER
  18    Sometimes set after writing GPU_VRAM_POWER
  19    GPU_MEMFILL_0/1 Busy (0=No, 1=Busy)
  20    GPU_MEMCOPY Busy     (0=No, 1=Busy; gets set some cycles after start)
```



## 1040005Ch - GPU\_MAKE\_WHATEVER\_MESS (R/W)


```
  0     Whatever, gets copied to bit8                   (W)

  16-21 Whatever, 00h..3Fh                              (R/W)
  24-29 Whatever, 00h..3Fh                              (R/W)
```

Affects the 30h-word pattern returned when reading below register.



## 10400060h - GPU\_STAT\_WHATEVER\_MESS (R)


```
  0-6   Unused? (0)
  7-22  Whatever Mess
  23    Unused? (0)
  24-29 Whatever Mess
  30-31 Unused? (0)
```

Repeatly reading returns a mess, repeated every 30h words, for example:

```
  08002400h, 01404180h, 04002000h, 00020000h, 20000200h, 02080000h, 00080000h,
  0041A000h, 11006100h, 00041000h, 00242000h, 00100880h, 1200A000h, 08000000h,
  10042080h, 04082400h, 00002400h, 00000000h, 1040C500h, 03000000h, ...
```

The same values as above are also returned when inserting delays in the read
loop. So it's either random generated... or a FIFO that reads junk from an
uninitialized array?

Changing 1040005Ch (eg. writing FFFFFFFFh) causes above to return different
garbage values (also reapeating each 30h words, but containing a more regular
pattern with fewer bits set).



## 10400068h  GPU\_UNKNOWN\_INITIALLY\_00A80000h (res=00A80000h) (R/W)

## 104000C4h - GPU\_BASE\_ADDR\_VRAM\_A (reset=18000000h) (R/W)



## 104000C8h - GPU\_BASE\_ADDR\_VRAM\_B (reset=18300000h) (R/W)


```
  0-31  Base address for VRAM_A/B blocks (0..FFFFFFFFh) (any alignment needed?)
```

The 3DS contains two 3MByte VRAM blocks (ie. 6Mbyte in total). These registers
allow to swap the base address of those two blocks, or to map them to other
locations within the following 12Mbyte region:

```
  18000000h..182FFFFFh  Usually VRAM_A (3Mbyte)
  18300000h..185FFFFFh  Usually VRAM_B (3Mbyte)
  18600000h..18BFFFFFh  Usually empty/zerofilled (6Mbyte)
```

Trying to map VRAM outside of that 12Mbyte region might work, but the ARM CPU
will trigger data aborts when trying to access that memory.



## 104000C0h - GPU\_BACKLIGHT\_OR\_SO\_1 (reset=20000000h) (R/W)



## 104000CCh - GPU\_BACKLIGHT\_OR\_SO\_2 (reset=20000000h) (R/W)


```
  0-31  Unknown (0..FFFFFFFFh)
```

Reportedly 104000C0h does "Writes 0 to allow backlights to turn off, 20000000h
to force them always on."

Unknown what that means. Default is 20000000h (and backlights CAN be switched
off in that state). Maybe "allow" means that they can switch off
automatically... upon GPU inactivity... or upon blank screen... or upon screen
saver timeouts... or whatever? Or maybe 20000000h is FCRAM base, completely
unrelated to backlights?

Note: Setting [104000C0h] or [104000CCh] to zero can cause [10400040h] to get
nonzero.

Most of the registers do have internal copies (the H/V registers, and Border
color, and maybe some others), changing these registers doesn't have any effect
on the visible picture & timings - until reaching the H/V-Latching Point
(which does forward the registers to their internal copies).

## 10400474h/10400574h - Interrupt Type (R/W)


```
  0      Display Enable (should be 1) (0=Off/screen fades out, 1=On/normal)
  1-7    Unused (0)
  8-10   Interrupt Mode (5=OncePerFrame, 7=None, 0..4,6=Special) (see below)
  7-11   Unused (0)
  16     Unknown...?    (0=???, 1=Normal)
  17-31  Unused (0)
```

The default is Interrupt Mode 5 (which acts as normal framerate interrupt).

Interrupt Mode 0,1,2,3 do require manually acknowledging/requesting the next
IRQ via Request register bit18 (and bit17 in some cases).

```
  Interrupt Mode 0:
  - Triggers here or there depending on H/V settings
  Interrupt Mode 1:
  - Triggers at V=[10400544h], H=[10400540h]               ;irq point
  - Triggers at V=[10400504h], H=[10400528h]..[10400566h]  ;picture area
  Interrupt Mode 2:
  - Triggers here or there depending on H/V settings
  Interrupt Mode 3:
  - Triggers at V=[10400504h], H=[10400528h]..[10400566h]  ;picture area
  Interrupt Mode 4 (in selected H's)
  - Triggers at V=[1040051Ch], and H=[10400542h]..[10400540h]
  Interrupt Mode 5 (framerate interrupt, usually at H=Hblank)
  - Triggers at V=[10400544h] and H=[10400540h]
  Interrupt Mode 6 (once on every H)
  - Triggers at V=[1040051Ch], and H=any
  Interrupt Mode 7 (interrupts disabled)
  - Doesn't trigger any IRQs.
```

For all IRQ H/V timings, mind that the display is drawn from left to right
(unlike normal top-to-bottom displays).

Note: Most of the H positions do actually trigger at H+1 (and perhaps similar
for V positions, though those are more difficult to measure).

Apart from bit0, all bits in the register are kind of "Request/Busy" flags (and
get cleared once when the request is handled).

```
  bit4:          cleared at H=[10400540h]..[10400542h]
  bit8,16,17,18: cleared after a handful of clock cycles
```

Request.bit4 does soemhow relate to the framebuffer selection in bit0 (see
STAT.bit4 for details)... Guess: maybe bit4 prevents bit0 from being internally
applied until hblank?

Obscure Color Format Notes:

Color components are laid out in reverse byte order, with the most significant
bits used first (ie. non-24bit pixels are stored as a little-endian values).
For instance, a raw data stream of two GL\_RGB565\_OES pixels looks like GGGBBBBB
RRRRRGGG GGGBBBBB RRRRRGGG. uh, that are TWO pixels, but which one is shown
first/bottom? uh, and that's for non-24bit, so, how does 24bit look like?

Contains the value of the color lookup table indexed by the above register.
Accessing this register will increase the index register by one.

For RGBA 8888/8880, the table should be usually filled with linear increasing
values: 000000h, 010101h, 020202h, 030303h, .., FFFFFFh. Or alternately with

The screen border isn't used for fullscreen pictures, but it could be used if
the picture is smaller than the actual screen. To disable the border, set
border start/end registers to the same value.

There are also "border middle" registers (with unknown purpose and without
visible effect, except, the middle values for vertical border MUST be within
border start/end range, otherwise the screen dies with fading out).

```

These are using the same Htotal for top/bottom screen, but different
picture/blanking widths (for top/bottom screens with 400pix/320pix width). The
top screen does also support a 800pix hires mode (which should use double
Htotal, and adjust other registers accordingly).


Note: The values in the H/V registers are 12bit wide, 0..FFFh (the upper
4bit/20bit of the 16bit/32bit registers are unused, always zero).


Wrong H/V values may cause various effects - which may differ depending on the
display type. New3DS bottom screen tends to output a stable image (with fading
upper/right areas if it is too small), or no picture at all (with whole screen
fading). However, other screens are said to lose sync or misalign lines and
such stuff.


Setting the V-pre-padding bigger than V-lower-border end causes the bottom-most
picture lines to display the most recent pixel color instead of fetching new
pixels from VRAM. A Similar effect occurs in upper picture area when setting
V-picture-size too small.


```

## Framebuffers


These LCD framebuffers normally contain the last rendered frames from the GPU.
The framebuffers are drawn from left-to-right, instead of top-to-bottom. Thus
the beginning of the framebuffer is drawn starting at the left side of the
screen.


Both of the 3D screen left/right framebuffers are displayed regardless of the
3D slider's state, however when the 3D slider is set to "off" the 3D effect is
disabled. Normally when the 3D slider's state is set to "off" the left/right
framebuffer addresses are set to the same physical address. When the 3D effect
is disabled and the left/right framebuffers are set to separate addresses, the
LCD seems to alternate between displaying the left/right framebuffer each
frame.

Uh, it can alternate left/right buffers each frame? I have NEVER seen that
effect when testing register settings (and it would have caused massive flicker
because I didn't had initialized the right buffer). What it can do is alternate
left/right buffer after each pixel horizontally (including on bottom screen).

Reportedly 10400478h/10400578h.bit0 "doesn't stay 1, read as 0", uh, actually
that applies for ALL OTHER bits in that register, but NOT for bit0.



## Further Registers


Apart from above GPU registers, the screens do also need initialization of the
"LCD" registers,

- [3DS Video LCD Registers](#3dsvideolcdregisters)
plus, initialization of whatever I2C registers for each screen. Plus some
MCU/I2C registers for backlight or so.

## Notes...


"The DisplayTransfer registers are only used if FLAGS.bit3=0 and ignored
otherwise. The TextureCopy registers are "likewise" only used if FLAGS.bit3=1,
and ignored otherwise."



## TextureCopy


When FLAGS.bit3=1, the hardware performs a TextureCopy-mode transfer. In this
mode, all other bits of that register are ignored (except for FLAGS.bit2, which
still needs to be set correctly?), and no format conversions are done.

Instead, it performs a raw data copy from the source to the destination, but
with a configurable gap between lines. The total amount of bytes to copy is
specified in the size register, and the hardware loops reading lines from the
input and writing them to the output until this amount is copied. The "gap"
specified in the input/output dimension register is the number of chunks to
skip after each "width" chunks of the input/output, and is NOT counted towards
the total size of the transfer.


By correctly calculating the input and output gap sizes it is possible to use
this functionality to copy arbitrary sub-rectangles between differently-sized
framebuffers or textures, which is one of its main uses over a regular
no-conversion DisplayTransfer. When copying tiled textures/framebuffers it's
important to remember that the contents of a tile are laid out sequentially in
memory, and so this should be taken into account when calculating the transfer
parameters.


Specifying invalid/junk values for the TextureCopy dimensions can result in the
GPU hanging while attempting to process this TextureCopy.

## Aliases


It is possible for multiple register (sequential) IDs to correspond to the same
register. This is done to leverage the consecutive writing mode for GPU
commands, which makes it possible for a single command to write data to
multiple sequential register IDs. For example, register IDs 02C1 through 02C8
all correspond to GPUREG\_VSH\_FLOATUNIFORM\_DATAi so that a consecutively writing
command based at 02C0 will write its first parameter to
GPUREG\_VSH\_FLOATUNIFORM\_INDEX and ever subsequent ones to
GPUREG\_VSH\_FLOATUNIFORM\_DATAi



## Data Types

# <a name="3dsgpuinternalregisterscommandlists"></a>3DS GPU Internal Registers - Command Lists



Commands (aka GPU registers writes) can be done by manually writing parameters
to register 10401000h-10401FFFh, or by using command lists.

With the command lists, the GPU does automatically read parameters and command
numbers from memory (and automatically pauses reading when it is busy).



## 104018E8h - PICA(023Ah) - GPUREG\_CMDBUF\_ADDR0 (aka entrypoint) (R/W)



## 104018ECh - PICA(023Bh) - GPUREG\_CMDBUF\_ADDR1 (aka entrypoint) (R/W)


```
  0      Unused (0)
  1-28   Physical address of 1st/2nd command buffer, in 16-byte units
```



## 104018E0h - PICA(0238h) - GPUREG\_CMDBUF\_SIZE0 (R/W)



## 104018E4h - PICA(0239h) - GPUREG\_CMDBUF\_SIZE1 (R/W)


The size value is required to indicate the end of the command list
(alternately, if GPUREG\_IRQ\_AUTOSTOP is enabled, command list execution will
also terminate when triggering an IRQ via FINALIZE command; which is usually
stored at end of command list).

```
  0      Unused (0)
  1-20   Size of command buffer, in 16-byte units
```

Observe that commands are multiples of 8 bytes (so one may need to append a
dummy 8-byte command for the 16-byte size boundary; unknown if there's a NOP
command for that purpose; reportedly FINALIZE command(s) are used for padding,
though that could trigger multiple IRQs when GPUREG\_IRQ\_AUTOSTOP is disabled).



## 104018F0h - PICA(023Ch) - GPUREG\_CMDBUF\_JUMP0 (jump to ADDR0) (W)



## 104018F4h - PICA(023Dh) - GPUREG\_CMDBUF\_JUMP1 (jump to ADDR0) (W)


```
  0-31   Don't care (writing any value starts CMDBUF execution, at ADDR0/1)
```

Executes the Command List, starting at CMDBUF\_ADDR0/1, until reaching
CMDBUF\_SIZE0/1 (or until FINALIZE+AUTOSTOP).


Unknown why there are two command lists, supposedly they cannot execute
simultaneously... maybe the second list is automatically started at the end of
the other list?



## Command List entries


Each entry in the command list does contain a "Command Header", and one or more
parameter words, the entry size must be a multiple of 8 bytes.

```
  00h 4   1st Parameter word
  04h 4   Command Header (see below)
  08h 4   2nd Parameter word (if any)
  0Ch 4   3rd Parameter word (if any)
  ... ..  Nth Parameter word (if any)
  xxh 4   Padding (zero) (if above wasn't a multiple of 8 bytes)
```

Command Header:

```

The ACK registers are basically mirrors of the REQ registers (and ARM11 could
write either one, causing IRQ acknowledge or request depending on whether the
written value does match the CMP compare bytes). However, there are at least
two small differences between ACK and REQ registers:

```
  GPU command list's can only write to GPUREG_IRQ_REQ
  ARM11 reads from GPUREG_IRQ_REQ cause ARM11 to wait if GPU is busy
```

Normally, CMP contains constant values, and REQ/ACK are changed to
same/different values when requesting/releasing interrupt requests.

Maybe related: Port 10400000h contains the same 00010002h readonly value.



## Notes


Nintendo uses the IRQ registers to trigger a "FINALIZE" interrupt at end of
command list, done as so:

```
  GPUREG_IRQ_MASK_LOW=FFFFFFF0h set upon GPU init  ;\enable first four IRQs
  GPUREG_IRQ_MASK_HIGH=FFFFFFFFh set upon GPU init ;/
  GPUREG_IRQ_AUTOSTOP=1                            ;-autostop cmdlist upon IRQ
  GPUREG_IRQ_CMP(0)=12345678h set upon GPU init    ;-first four compare values
  GPUREG_IRQ_ACK(0)=00000000h set upon GPU init and before cmdlist
  GPUREG_IRQ_REQ(0)=12345678h set via PICA(0010h) FINALIZE at end of cmdlist
```

Due to the 32bit writes, that will actually trigger four byte-matches at once.

Caution:

The GPU command list can write to GPUREG\_IRQ\_REQ(n), but all other registers in
range PICA(0000h..003Fh) are writeable by CPU only, not via command lists.

at BEGIN of each strip/fan, not at the end).

Restart occurs on writing any value... but the written value is R/W, so it
might have some purpose?


```
 __________________________ Vertex Attribute Arrays ___________________________
```


ATTR\_BUF arrays contain vertex attributes (such like coordinates and colors).
The GPU can automatically transfer data from these arrays to the shader unit
(which does then forward the data to the drawing hardware).

There are up to 12 arrays for up to 12 attributes (one can either store
multiple attributes in one single array, or store different attributes in
separate arrays).

Padding: Does "skip" array entries? (maybe useful when having texturing
disabled, whilst still having texture info in the array?).

Reportedly there is some alignment issue/feature for padding. And also an
alignment issue for components or so; maybe halfword/float32 need to be
aligned? There is no alignment restriction for components that consist of bytes
(eg. 3x8bit RGB does work).

XXX are multiple arrays also counted as multiple reads?



## 104018B8h - PICA(022Eh) - GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_DRAWARRAYS - Increasing Indices (W)



## 104018BCh - PICA(022Fh) - GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_DRAWELEMENTS - With INDEX\_LIST (W)


Writing to either of these registers starts sending the amount of data
specified in NUMVERTICES from ATTR\_BUF's to the vertex shader.

```
  0-31   Don't care (writing any value starts drawing from ATTR_BUF)
```

The only difference between DRAWARRAYS and DRAWELEMENTS are the array indices:

```
  DRAWARRAYS uses increasing indices, starting at GPUREG_ATTR_BUF_FIRST_INDEX.
  DRAWELEMENTS uses array indices from GPUREG_ATTR_BUF_INDEX_LIST.
```



## 104018A8h - PICA(022Ah) - GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_FIRST\_INDEX (R/W)


```
  0-31   Starting index in ATTR_BUF arrays (usually 0, to start with 1st entry)
```

Used only for for DRAWARRAYS (not used for DRAWELEMENTS, which does instead
read indices from the INDEX\_LIST).



## 1040189Ch - PICA(0227h) - GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_INDEX\_LIST (R/W)

Used only for DRAWELEMENTS. The index list allows to re-use ATTR\_BUF entries
for multiple vertices (triangle strips are automatically re-using vertices from
the previous triangle, however, with the index list, one can also re-use
vertices from the previous strips; which can save about 50% of memory).

 __________________________ Fixed Vertex Attributes ___________________________
```


The Fixed Attribute registers can be used in two ways:


```
  1) Setting attribute(s) to fixed settings (similar to FLOATUNIFORM
     registers). For example, one could re-use a shader that was
     programmed to support variable colors with fixed colors.
     Unknown if fixed settings are also working for partial attributes
     (eg. 2D graphics with X,Y coordinates and fixed Z,W values).
  2) Using [GPUREG_FIXEDATTRIB_INDEX]=0Fh does directly send vertex
     attribute(s) to the shader unit (this could be "easier" than setting
     up ATTR_BUF arrays in memory, however, in practice it is extremely
     uncomfortable (due to the weird data format with 4x24bit float values
     sent in reversed 32bit word order).
```



## 104018C8h - PICA(0232h) - GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_INDEX (W)


```
  0-3    Fixed attribute index (00h-0Bh=Index, 0Fh=immediate-mode submission)
```

Selects the index of the fixed attribute to be input with
GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_DATAi.



## 104018CCh - PICA(0233h) - GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_DATA(0) (HIGH) (W)



## 104018D0h - PICA(0234h) - GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_DATA(1) (MID) (W)



## 104018D4h - PICA(0235h) - GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_DATA(2) (LOW) (W)


```
  0-23   float1.7.16, Vertex attribute X
  24-47  float1.7.16, Vertex attribute Y
  48-71  float1.7.16, Vertex attribute Z
  72-95  float1.7.16, Vertex attribute W
```

The above 96bit value is split into three 32bit words, and, weirdly,

```
  the word order for writing is HIGH,MID,LOW (aka big endian style)
  the byte order per 32bit word is little endian
```

More uncomfortably, fixed attributes must be in 4x24bit float format (with
X,Y,Z,W, even when needing only X,Y, and with 24bit float, instead of more
comfortable formats like 8bit/16bit integer or 32bit float)

Note: The three DATA registers are mirrors of each other, one could write the
HIGH,MID,LOW words all to DATA0, or to DATA0..2.

# <a name="3dsgpuinternalregistersshaderregisters"></a>3DS GPU Internal Registers - Shader registers



There are four shader units, each having its own set of I/O registers:

```
  10401A00h - PICA(0280h..) - Shader 0 (Geometry Shader, aka GSH)
  10401AC0h - PICA(02B0h..) - Shader 1 (Vertex Shader, aka VSH)
  10401B80h - PICA(02E0h..) - Shader 2 (Unknown purpose)
  10401C40h - PICA(0310h..) - Shader 3 (Unknown purpose)
```

The vertex shader can reportedly use three shader units at once (or all four
units, when not using the geometry shader). Even when using multiple units as
vertex shader, one does only need to initialize the Shader 1 registers.

Unknown if the Shader 2 and 3 registers are having any special purpose for yet
unknown special effects (maybe for the undescribed "reserved geometry shader
subdivision" feature, or maybe for the "procedural texture" unit, or maybe they
are just dummy registers).

Sets the shader unit input register index which will correspond to each
attribute contained by the input buffer (which in the case of geometry shaders
is the vertex shader output buffer (uh, that says that there is ONE vertex
shader, and MULTIPLE geometry shaders?)) for attributes 0 through 15.

For example, having LOW.bit0-3 set to 5 means that, in the shader program, v5
will contain the input buffer's 1st attribute.

For example, having HIGH.bit0-3 set to 5 means that, in the shader program, v5
will contain the input buffer's 9th attribute.

somewhat semantic?

Uh, ATTR\_PERMUTATION is a scary homebrew slang for ATTR\_IDs?

Used to scale the vertex coordinates (usually in range -1.0 to +1.0) to screen

```
  0-31   float1.7.24, 2/size

Used as stepping offsets when interpolating colors (and textures?) between

but with "inverse" division, ie. "H=2/width" and "V=2/height" (instead of
"width/2" and "height/2").

For the odd floating point format, one could adjust one of the more common
formats (assuming sign=0 for the latter two cases):

```
  (float24)*100h                  ;convert float1.7.16 to float1.7.24
  (float32)*2-40000000h           ;convert float1.8.23 to float1.7.24
  (float64)/10000000h-0C0000000h  ;convert float1.11.52 to float1.7.24

These registers are for "Procedural Texture", whatever that means. Probably
something for automatically generating or animating plasma/fire/water textures.

As far as known, these are controlled solely by the parameters in the registers
below (without actually using/supporting custom program code on the shader
units or so).

See GPUREG\_TEXUNIT\_CONFIG.bit8,9,10 for enable flag... and for selecting
coordinates from texture unit 0, 1, or 2. Unknown what those coordinates are
used for... as additional incoming PROCTEX parameters, or maybe the PROCTEX
unit does output coordinates to the selected texture unit?

 ____________________ Procedural Texture Generation Notes _____________________
```



## Overview


Procedural texture generation has four stages:

```
  Noise Module (outputs u',v')
  Repeat Module (outputs u'',v'')
  Base Shape (also notated as G(u'',v''), output g)
  F(g) and Lookup Table
```



## Noise Module


This stage applies noise on the input coordinates. Little is known about this
other than that there are three noise parameters: Amplitude, Frequency, and
Phase.



## Repeat Module


This stage performs basic texture coordinate wrapping on the noised
coordinates. It supports symmetric and mirrored wrapping. They don't seem to be
configurable beyond that.



## Base Shape


The U'' and V'' coordinates are used to generate a scalar value in the range
[0;1] from the wrapped coordinates using one of six functions.

The output of this function is named "g".



## F(g) and Lookup Table


F is a selectable function which transforms g to another scalar value. There
are two known options for F:

```
  the identity function
  a triangle function
```

The final texel color is determined by using the value of F(g) as an index into
a configurable lookup table.

## Unused command numbers PICA(0000h..000Fh, 0020h..003Fh)


Registers at 10401000h..1040103Fh and 10401080h..104010FFh are writeable by
ARM11 only, not via PICA command numbers 0000h..000Fh, 0020h..003Fh.



## Unused command numbers PICA(0400h..FFFFh)


The PICA command numbers in CMDBUF are said to be 16bit wide, however, values
0400h..FFFFh seem to be unused (and there are no I/O addresses for them;
accessing 10402000h and up triggers data abort).

# <a name="3dsgpushaderinstructionsetblurp"></a>3DS GPU Shader Instruction Set - Blurp




## Overview


A compiled shader binary is comprised of two parts: the main instruction
sequence and the operand descriptor table. These are both sent to the GPU
around the same time but using separate GPU Commands. Instructions (such as
format 1 instruction) may reference operand descriptors. When such is the case,
the operand descriptor ID is the offset, in words, of the descriptor within the
table. Both instructions and descriptors are coded in little endian. Basic
implementations of the following specification can be found at [1] and [2]. The
instruction set seems to have been heavily inspired by Microsoft's vs\_3\_0 [3]
and the Direct3D shader code [4]. Please note that this page is being written
as the instruction set is reverse engineered; as such it may very well contain
mistakes.


Debug information found in the code.bin of "Ironfall: Invasion" suggests that
there may not be more than 512 instructions and 128 operand descriptors in a
shader.



## Nomenclature


- - opcode names with I appended to them are the same as their non-I version,
        - except they use the inverted instruction format, giving 7 bits to SRC2
        - (and access to uniforms) and 5 bits to SRC1
- - opcode names with U appended to them are the same as their non-U version,
        - except they are executed conditionally based on the value of a uniform
        - boolean.
- - opcode names with C appended to them are the same as their non-C version,
        - except they are executed conditionally based on a logical expression
        - specified in the instruction.

## Instructions


Unless noted otherwise, SRC1 and SRC2 refer to their respectively indexed
float[4] registers (after swizzling). Similarly, DST refers to its indexed
register modulo destination component masking, i.e. an expression like DST=SRC1
might actually just set DST.y to SRC1.y.

## Shader Operand descriptors (OPDESC's)


Below 31bit (or 32bit?) are related to the 5bit/7bit "DESC" id's in opcode
LSBs.

```
  0      Destination component mask W (0=Don't change, 1=Write)
  1      Destination component mask Z (0=Don't change, 1=Write)
  2      Destination component mask Y (0=Don't change, 1=Write)
  3      Destination component mask X (0=Don't change, 1=Write)
  4      Source 1 Negation bit
  5-6    Source 1 Component 3 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W) (usually 3)
  7-8    Source 1 Component 2 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W) (usually 2)
  9-10   Source 1 Component 1 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W) (usually 1)
  11-12  Source 1 Component 0 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W) (usually 0)
  13     Source 2 Negation bit
  14-15  Source 2 Component 3 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  16-17  Source 2 Component 2 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  18-19  Source 2 Component 1 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  20-21  Source 2 Component 0 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  22     Source 3 Negation bit
  23-24  Source 3 Component 3 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  25-26  Source 3 Component 2 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  27-28  Source 3 Component 1 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  29-30  Source 3 Component 0 value   (0..3 = X,Y,Z,W)
  31     unnown/unspecified/unused (usually 0)
```

The component selector (the 8bit fragments with 4x2bits) enables swizzling. For
example, component selector 0x1B is equivalent to .xyzw, while 0x55 is
equivalent to .yyyy.


Depending on the current shader opcode, source components are disabled
implicitly by setting (\*to ZERO\*) the destination component mask. For example,
ADD o0.xy, r0.xyzw, r1.xyzw will not make use of r0's or r1's z/w components,
while DP4 o0.xy, r0.xyzw, r1.xyzw will use all input components regardless of
the used destination component mask.



## Relative addressing


```
  IDX  Address offset
  00h  +0       ;-no offset
  01h  +a0.x    ;\X or Y component of address register (see MOVA)
  02h  +a0.y    ;/
  03h  +lp      ;-loop counter (see LOOP)
```

There are 3 address registers: a0.x, a0.y and aL (loop counter). For format 1
instructions, when IDX != 0, the value of the corresponding address register is
added to SRC1's value. For example, if IDX = 2, a0.y = 3 and SRC1 = c8, then
instead SRC1+a0.y = c11 will be used for the instruction. It is only possible
to use address registers with vector uniform registers, attempting to use them
with input attribute or temporary registers results in the address register
being ignored (i.e. read as zero).


a0.x and a0.y are set manually through the MOVA instruction by rounding a float
value to integer precision. Hence, they may take negative values.


aL can only be set indirectly by the LOOP instruction. It is still accessible
and valid after exiting a LOOP block, though.



## Comparison operator


```
  CMPX/CMPY raw value   Operator name   Expression
  00h                   EQ              src1 == src2
  01h                   NE              src1 != src2
  02h                   LT              src1 < src2
  03h                   LE              src1 <= src2
  04h                   GT              src1 > src2
  05h                   GE              src1 >= src2
  06h                   ??              seems to always return true
  07h                   ??              seems to always return true
```



## Conditions


A number of format 2 instructions are executed conditionally. These conditions
are based on two boolean registers which can be set with CMP: cmp.x and cmp.y.


Conditional instructions include 3 parameters: CONDOP, REFX and REFY. REFX and
REFY are reference values which are tested for equality against cmp.x and
cmp.y, respectively. CONDOP describes how the final truth value is constructed
from the results of the two tests. There are four conditional expression
formats:

```
  CONDOP raw value    Expression                        Description
  00h                 cmp.x == REFX || cmp.y == REFY    OR
  01h                 cmp.x == REFX && cmp.y == REFY    AND
  02h                 cmp.x == REFX                     X
  03h                 cmp.y == REFY                     Y
```



## Registers


Input attribute registers (v0-v7?) store the per-vertex data given by the CPU
and hence are read-only.

Output attribute registers (o0-o6) hold the data to be passed to the later GPU
stages and are write-only. Each of the output attribute register components is
assigned a semantic by setting the corresponding GPU\_Internal\_Registers.

Uniform registers hold user-specified data which is constant throughout all
processed vertices. There are 96 float[4] uniform registers (c0-c95),
eight(???) boolean registers (b0-b7), and four int[4] registers (i0-i3).

Temporary registers (r0-r15) can be used for intermediate calculations and can
both be read and written.

Many shader instructions which take float arguments have only 5 bits available
for the second argument. They may hence only refer to input attributes or
temporary registers. In particular, it's not possible to pass two float[4]
uniforms to these instructions.

It appears that writing twice to the same output register can cause problems
(eg. GPU hangs).


DST mapping:

```
  DST raw value  Register name   Description
  00h-06h?       o0-o6?          Output registers (aka output FIFO) (W)
  10h-1Fh        r0-r15          Temporary registers (R/W)
```


SRC1/SRC2/SRC3 mapping:

```
  SRC raw value  Register name   Description
  00h-07h?       v0-v7?          Input vertex/attribute (aka input FIFO) (R)
  10h-1Fh        r0-r15          Temporary registers
  20h-7Fh        c0-c95          Vector uniform registers (only for 7bit SRC)
```



## Control Flow


Control flow is implemented using four independent stacks:

```
  4-deep CALL stack
  8-deep IF stack
  4-deep LOOP stack
```

All stacks are initially empty. After every instruction but before JMP takes
effect, the PC is incremented and a copy is sent to each stack. Each stack is
checked against its copy of the PC. If an entry is popped from the stack, the
copied PC is updated and used for the next check of this stack, although the
IF/LOOP stacks can each only pop one entry per instruction, whereas the CALL
stack is checked again until it doesn't match or the stack is empty. The
updated PC copy with the highest priority wins: LOOP (highest), IF, CALL, JMP,
original PC (lowest).

## Array Attributes (via ARRAY pointers)


The most common way seems to be drawing via GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_xxx and
GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_DRAWARRAYS, the GPU is then automatically reading vertex data
from the array pointers (instead of needing to send all vertices to the command
buffer).



## Fixed Vertex Attributes (fixed attr for ALL vertices)


To use a fixed attribute, set the bit corresponding to the attribute in
GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_FORMAT\_HIGH and ensure that no vertex arrays are configured for
the attribute (any configured arrays will override the fixed value, regardless
of the bit setting). Even if a vertex array isn't being used for the attribute
it still needs to be counted in the number of active attributes specified in
the same register.



## Immediate-Mode Vertex Submission (via GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_DATA)


Instead of using vertex arrays to supply vertex data, drawing can be done by
directly writing vertex data to a register. This allows vertex data to be
inlined directly in the command buffer. Since this is restricted to 4-component
float data, it is more useful for small draws like UI elements or debug
displays, to avoid using an unreasonable amount of memory and processing time
appending the vertices to the command buffer.


To use this feature, configure the number of attributes per vertex in
GPUREG\_VSH\_NUM\_ATTR. (All settings in the registers related to the vertex
loader are ignored.) Then setup the GPU and shaders the same as if doing a
regular draw call with GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_DRAWARRAYS or
GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUF\_DRAWELEMENTS, but instead of writing to either register, write
the value 0xF to GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_INDEX and then follow by repeatedly writing
vertex data to GPUREG\_FIXEDATTRIB\_DATA.


Each set of writes to the 3 data registers specifies one attribute and all
attributes (as configured in GPUREG\_VSH\_NUM\_ATTR) need to be written, in order,
to specify a vertex. Drawing happens automatically as vertices are specified.
After finishing specifying vertices, follow with the same writes used after a
draw arrays/elements.




# <a name="3dsgpufragmentlighting"></a>3DS GPU Fragment Lighting



Fragment lighting is a DMP extension to the standard OpenGL pipeline with which
applications can calculate object lighting for each rendered pixel instead of
just per vertex. The fragment lighting algorithm furthermore supports the
shading models Blinn-Phong, Cook-Terrance, Ward, and microfacet-based
BRDF-models. While the lighting calculations take place in a very localized
position of the pixel processing pipeline, the feature interacts with different
other pipeline stages.



## Overview


In general, lighting is calculated at a particular point in space X by
determining the angles (i.e. dot products) between different vectors:

```
  - The face normal vector N, which points from X to the direction
    perpendicular to the lighted object
  - The tangent vector T, which points from X to a direction which is
    tangential to the lighted object
  - The bitangent vector B, which points to a tangential direction such
    that it is orthogonal to both N and T
  - The view vector V, which points from X "into the camera"
  - The light vector L, which points from X to the light source (note that
    lighting is always evaluated separately for each light source; the
    results for multiple light sources can simply be added to each other)
```

For example, in the Blinn-Phong shading model the dot product of L and N
determined the intensity of a lighting type called diffuse lighting. More
generally, the dot products between these vectors (from now on simply referred
to as "dot products") are combined to a lighting equation, which is evaluated
once per light source at each considered point in space.


Before pixel shaders were common, the lighting equation was only considered at
each vertex, and the output color was then interpolated across the triangle. To
achieve higher visual quality, pixel shaders can be used nowadays to evaluate
the lighting equation at each pixel. The PICA200 does not have a programmable
pixel shader, but has a fixed-function pipeline stage to achieve the same
quality.


In any case, per-pixel lighting requires to somehow obtain a normal vector for
each pixel. Theoretically, the vertex shader could output one normal vector per
vertex, and per-pixel normals could then be obtained by interpolating these
vectors in a specific way. This, however, is very inefficient, which is why
vertex shaders on the PICA200 instead output mathematical objects called
quaternions: Quaternions can be computed from normal/tangent vectors, and vice
versa, so no information is lost by doing so. However, quaternion interpolation
is a lot faster (see the "Kuijk and Blake" source below), and so the GPU can
compute per-pixel normals simply using the interpolated quaternion. This is
just the general idea, and the dirty mathematical details are explained below.


In addition to allowing per-pixel calculations, the lighting equation used in
the PICA200 involves using the dot products as indices into configurable lookup
tables. A good example of why this is useful is cell-shading, which can be
achieved simply by setting adjacent lookup table values to the same color.



## Quaternions as Shader Outputs


The shaders are usually the point where normal and tangent vector information
flows in. Usually, the source vertex data will include normal vectors for each
vertex. This need not be the case though; one could also just input raw vertex
positions, and have a geometry shader automatically calculate normal vector
information.


In any case: There is no vertex output attribute semantic for normal or tangent
vectors. To use fragment lighting, the shader must actually output an attribute
with the quaternion semantic. So some sort of conversion needs to happen from
normal and tangent vectors to quaternions. This can be done using the
surface-local matrix.



## Quaternion Interpolation


Quaternion interpolation needs to happen to obtain a per-fragment quaternion,
from which in turn per-fragment normals and tangent vectors can be computed. It
is unknown how quaternions are interpolated on the PICA200. The architecture
suggests that plain linear interpolation is used, but there are also more
sophisticated algorithms like Slerp and Nlerp.



## Quaternions and Normal/Tangent Vectors


Quaternions describe a transformation from surface-local space to eye space. In
surface-local space, by definition (and up to permutation) the normal vector is
(0,0,1), the tangent vector is (1,0,0), and the bitangent vector is (0,1,0).


Alternatively, one may consider quaternions a transformation from eye space to
surface-local space.



## Fragment Lighting Equation


There are two lighting equations: One for the primary color and one for the
secondary color. Both of them are given in section 3.2.2 of the "Kazakov and
Ohbuchi" source below. In addition, the fragment lighting can be set up to
write to the alpha channel of the primary or secondary color depending on a
selectable angle and a LUT. The equations used can be found here: 
- [http://mathb.in/26766](http://mathb.in/26766)

Some common setups include:

```

```

s is the specularity factor for Blinn-Phong.


Spotlight setup means input -L dot P and contents spotlight falloff.

The Fresnel LUT can be used to, for example, blend two colours according to how
oblique the view angle is, or to simply additively blend white onto fragments
with an exponential falloff, resulting in rim lighting.



## Fragment Lighting Output


The fragment lighting results are accessible as two inputs to the texture
combiners (one for the primary color, one for the secondary color).



## Resources


There is public literature available which describes the fragment lighting
feature in more detail:

```
  - Everitt - "Per-Pixel Lighting": A presentation given at the Game
    Developers Conference 2001 about per-pixel lighting. It doesn't have
    anything to do with the PICA200 algorithm, but explains the core ideas
    very well (especially the concepts of surface-local space and how it
    relates to other coordinate systems).
  - Kazakov and Ohbuchi - "Primitive Processing and Advanced Shading
    Architecture for Embedded Space": Provides a general overview over the
    fragment lighting algorithm used by the PICA200 and provides explicit
    formulas for the primary and secondary lighting output. NOTE: There exist
    both a scientific publication and a short presentation with this title.
    Both are useful, but the former goes into much greater detail.
  - Ohbuchi and Unno - "A Real-Time Configurable Shader Based on Lookup
    Tables": Provides a very detailed explanantion of the fragment lighting
    implementation
  - Kuijk and Blake - "Faster Phong Shading via Angular Interpolation":
    Explains in greater detail how quaternions can be used to encode
    information about normals and tangents (and how quaternions are easier to
    interpolate than vectors).

## Vertex attribute alignment


Vertex components which are defined through GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUFi\_CONFIG\_LOW will be
accessed aligned by the GPU.

Vertex attributes will be aligned to their component element size.

Padding attributes (Component type > 11) will always aligned to 4 byte
offets into the buffer.

The stride which is passed to the GPU should be passed unaligned.



## Vertex stride in GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUFi\_CONFIG\_HIGH


The vertex stride set in GPUREG\_ATTR\_BUFi\_CONFIG\_HIGH must match the actual
size of the vertex contained in the buffer or the PICA will freeze or it won't
draw anything.

If you want to use a different stride you have to pad the data accordingly with
padding attributes.



## Output mapping in GPUREG\_SH\_OUTMAP\_MASK


The output masking in GPUREG\_SH\_OUTMAP\_MASK influences how the registers
starting at GPUREG\_SH\_OUTMAP\_Oi map to outputs in the shader.


If an output is disabled in GPUREG\_SH\_OUTMAP\_MASK it means that no slot in the
GPUREG\_SH\_OUTMAP\_Oi registers is consumed. GPUREG\_SH\_OUTMAP\_TOTAL configures
the number of used consecutive slots in the outmap. Example:

```
  GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_TOTAL = 0x00000002      ;2 outputs enabled
  GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_MASK  = 0x00000011      ;o0 enabled, o4 enabled
  GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_O0    = 0x03020100      ;o0 = pos.xyzw
  GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_O1    = 0x0B0A0908      ;o4 = color.rgba    ;<-- o4 in "O1"!
  GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_O2    = ...             ;(unused)
```



## Shaders - Configued Output components must be written exactly once


Each configured output component has to be written exactly once or the PICA
freezes.



## Shaders - MOVA instructions can't be adjacent


Having 2 consecutive MOVA instructions will freeze the PICA. This can be
relaxed by placing a NOP between 2 MOVAs or by rearranging the code.



## Shader - Special cases


JMP overwrites the PC \*after\* the stacks checks (and only if no stack was
popped).

Executing a BREAK on an empty LOOP stack hangs the GPU.

A stack overflow discards the oldest element, so you could think of it as a
queue or a ring buffer.

If the CALL stack is popped four times in a row, the fourth update to its copy
of the PC is missed (the third PC update will be propagated). Probably a
hardware bug.



## Shader - Floating-Point Behavior


The PICA200 is not IEEE-compliant. It has positive and negative infinities and
NaN, but does not seem to have negative 0. Input and output subnormals are
flushed to +0. The internal floating point format seems to be the same as used
in shader binaries: 1 sign bit, 7 exponent bits, 16 (explicit) mantissa bits.
Several instructions also have behavior that differs from the IEEE functions.
Here are the results from some tests done on hardware (s = largest subnormal, n
= smallest positive normal):

```
  Computation     Result  Notes
  inf * 0         0       Including inside MUL, MAD, DP4, etc.
  NaN * 0         NaN
  +inf - +inf     NaN     Indicates +inf is real inf, not FLT_MAX
  rsq(rcp(-inf))  +inf    Indicates that there isn't -0.0.
  rcp(-0)         +inf    no -0 so differs from IEEE where rcp(-0) = -inf
  rcp(0)          +inf
  rcp(+inf)       0
  rcp(NaN)        NaN
  rsq(-0)         +inf    no -0 so differs from IEEE where rsq(-0) = -inf
  rsq(-2)         NaN
  rsq(+inf)       0
  rsq(-inf)       NaN
  rsq(NaN)        NaN
  max(0, +inf)    +inf
  max(0, -inf)    -inf
  max(0, NaN)     NaN     max violates IEEE but match GLSL spec
  max(NaN, 0)     0
  max(-inf, +inf) +inf
  min(0, +inf)    0
  min(0, -inf)    -inf
  min(0, NaN)     NaN     min violates IEEE but match GLSL spec
  min(NaN, 0)     0
  min(-inf, +inf) -inf
  cmp(s, 0)       false   cmp does not flush input subnormals
  max(s, 0)       s       max does not flush input or output subnormals
  mul(s, 2)       0       input subnormals are flushed in arithmetic
                            instructions
  mul(n, 0.5)     0       output subnormals are flushed in arithmetic
                            instructions
```

1.0 can be multiplied 63 times by 0.5 until the result compares equal zero.
This is consistent with a 7-bit exponent and output subnormal flushing.



## Command list related


Invalid GPU command parameters including NaN floats can cause the GPU to hang,
which then causes the "GSP module" to hang as well.




# <a name="3dsgpuprimitiveengineandshaders"></a>3DS GPU Primitive Engine and Shaders



The 3DS seems to have four "shaders", each with there own I/O ports. However,
the vertex shaders seem to be used in parallel (to process 3 or 4 vertices at
once... so it's unknown if one needs to initialize all sets of I/O ports
separately; 3dbrew seems to have only two shaders documented (GSH and VSH),
without even being aware of the VSH2 and VSH3 registers.



## Vertex Shader (VSH)


The Vertex Shader is used to forward incoming vertex data (coordinates, colors,
texcoords) to the drawing engine. Most commonly, the shader would be used to
multiply the incoming coordinates with a Position Matrix and/or Projection
Matrix.



## Geometry Shader (GSH)


The Geometry Shader can be used to do something... but it appears to be unknown
what, and how.

It can probably somehow receive incoming values from somewhere. And probably
output values to somewhere (maybe somehow forwarding them to other GPU
registers, and maybe somehow sending them as response to the CPU).

The "EMIT" opcode might output data from Geometry Shader to Vertex shader?

The "Primitive Engine" section below might refer to the geometry shader?



## Primitive Engine


Primitive Engine (PE) is one of the PICA200's four vertex processor units and
provides some unique features which are used to implement a geometry shader
stage and variable-size primitive rendering.

The full functionality of PE is not yet understood and remains to be
reverse-engineered.

Variable-size primitives are implemented by prefixing each per-primitive
sequence of indices in an index array with a primitive size. This is used for
various effects, for example Catmull-Clark subdivision and Loop subdivision. It
is unknown how this feature is enabled specifically.

Caution: There will be no further data received after overrun. To avoid
overrun, be sure to read data fast enough, and disable CAM\_CNT.bit15 after
reading the camera bitmap.



## 1012x006h - CAM\_??? - Unknown (R/W)


```
  0-5   Unknown (no effect?) (can be set to 0..3Fh)                       (R/W)

Unknown, bit0-5 seems to have no direct effect on the camera picture. Maybe
selects timings or amount of words for DMA requests? Or maybe some bits
resemble DSi's CAM\_MCNT register?



## 1012x010h - CAM\_SOFS alike DSi cameras (0..01FF03FEh) (R/W)



## 1012x014h - CAM\_EOFS alike DSi cameras (0..01FF03FEh) (R/W)


```
  0      Unused (0)                                                         (0)

```

Looks same as on DSi, but the settings seem to have no effect on 3DS, ie. there
appears to be no way to enable the trimming feature?



## 1032x000h..1032x07Fh - CAM\_DAT - Data FIFO (20h words window) (R)


The FIFO read window is 20h words in size (the actual FIFO is bigger; about
500h or A00h words?). The (default) data format is same as the YUV422 format
for DSi cameras:

```
  0-7   First Pixel Luminance (Y)   (unsigned, 00h..FFh, FFh=white)
  8-15  Both Pixels Blue (Cb aka U) (unsigned, 00h..FFh, 80h=gray)
  16-23 Second Pixel Luminance (Y)  (unsigned, 00h..FFh, FFh=white)
  24-31 Both Pixels Red (Cr aka V)  (unsigned, 00h..FFh, 80h=gray)
```

Caution: It is important to read words from INCREASING addresses at
1032x000h..1032x07Fh (or at least toggle address bit2 after each read) (trying
to read words from FIXED address 1032x000h will return the same word endless
repeated).



## Camera Notes


The "camera in-use" LED for external camera is controlled via MCU (but the LED
exists on DSi/3DS only, New3DS doesn't have that LED installed).

The three 3DS/New3DS cameras have the same Chip IDs (2280h) as found in the two
DSi's Aptina MT9V113 cameras.

However, New3DS is said to have improved picture quality. Unknown what that
means, maybe the I2C registers are simply initialized with better gain settings
at software side, or maybe the camera hardware is actually improved despite of
having the same chip id.

New3DS is also said to support eye-tracking, whatever that means, it is
probably done using the internal camera. And New3DS is said to have an IR-LED
next to the internal camera to assist eye-tracking (yet unknown if/how the
YUV/RGB camera could see IR-light at all).

Input formats...

```
  INPUT_YUV422_INDIV_8   0     is that 8bit? or 8x8pix? or divide by 8?
  INPUT_YUV420_INDIV_8   1
  INPUT_YUV422_INDIV_16  2     is that 16bit? or 16x16pix? or divide by 16?
  INPUT_YUV420_INDIV_16  3
  INPUT_YUV422_BATCH     4     aka camera YUYV
```

Conversion is done in units of 8 lines. However, the first Input block must be
9 lines (unless the total height is smaller), and the final blocks can be
smaller (depending on amount of remaining lines). For example:

```
  Send 9,8,8,8,8,3 scanlines    ;\for 44 scanlines
  Recv 8,8,8,8,8,4 scanlines    ;/
```

The odd amount of sending 9 lines in 1st block might allow to keep converting
data while receiving responses.

```
  XXX does that 9-lines-input thing also apply to Input Format 0-3 ?

strobe/trigger/ack/reset some internal stuff?



## Standard YUV to RGB Formula (aka YCbCr to RGB)


The standard formula uses the constants shown below. However, one can also
different values in the Y2R\_MULTIPLIER\_xxx and Y2R\_OFFSET\_xxx registers (that
would allow to support other YUV variants, or to adjust more pale or more
colorful output, or even to change RGB to BGR order; if the input FIFOs are
also swapped accordingly).

```
  R = Y*1.00 + (Cr-80h)*1.402
  G = Y*1.00 - (Cr-80h)*0.714)-(Cb-80h)*0.344
  B = Y*1.00 + (Cb-80h)*1.772
  Clip results to MinMax(00h,FFh), and apply final divide by 8 for RGB555.
```

Note: In the standard YUV-to-RGB formula one would usually subtract 80h from
the U/V values before multiplication. However, the 3DS does instead add
variable offsets after multiplication (so those offsets need to be matched to
the multipliers).

Line-to-Block. They are similar to the YUV-to-RGBA converters, but merely
converting from RGB-to-RGBA (and also allowing to convert between 5bit and 8bit
color depths). And, they are always re-ordering the data from scanline format
to swizzled texture format:

```

Used as alpha for output format 8888 and 5551 (the latter uses only bit7 of the
8bit value).

Note: Any alpha values written to the input fifo are ignored, the alpha value
is always taken from the alpha register, not from the incoming pixels.



## 10330000h/10331000h - New3DS - L2B\_FIFO (R and W) (empty=data\_abort)

The FIFO is mirrored across a 1000h-byte window (but eight large scanlines may
be larger than that, so it's better to used a fixed FIFO address instead of
increasing addresses in that window).

Unknown. New3DS only. MVD might be short for Movie Decoder or so?

Unknown if there are any FIFOs and CDMA peripheral IDs... there are none known
yet... maybe the thing does have it's own "DMA" hardware for direct memory
access without needing CDMA?

The ID value 67312398h appears to be known as "HW\_ID" for linux/android "VPU

  /kernel/arch/arm/mach-rockchip/vcodec_service.c
```

which defines VPU\_DEC\_ID\_9190=6731h (the upper 16bit of the 67312398h value),
so the "MVD" might be identical to that Rockchip hardware (whatever that is).




# <a name="3dsvideolgyregisterslegacygbandsvideotoframebuffer"></a>3DS Video LGY Registers (Legacy GBA/NDS Video to Framebuffer)



The LGYFB units are for forwarding GBA/NDS/DSi video to 3DS screens with
optional scaling. The input comes directly from the GBA/NDS video controller,
the output must be DMAed to memory.

That is, ARM11 must handle that memory transfers in background while running
GBA/NDS/DSi software on ARM7/ARM9 side.

Once when started, the transfer does auto-repeat each frame (although, that may
hang with some/wrong settings; in that case it can help to toggle CNT.bit0

The Output Block Line Number can be used to compute the destination address for
IRQ bit0/1. The initial line number upon reset is random/garbage (but gets
valid after setting LGYFB\_CNT.bit0).

Overrun can occur when not reading the output FIFO fast enough. After overrun,
bit1 triggers only on each 2nd block, and bit2 won't trigger at all.

```

Use DMAWFP opcode (Wait for Peripheral) before reading an 8-line block. Or,
wait for LGYFB\_IRQ\_STAT bit0/1, and then manually start the DMA for one 8-line
block (the latter can be useful for transfers with clockwise rotate; where one
may need to patch the destination address for each block).

```

The sum of six input values should be 400h (the hardware does automatically
clip results to min/max brightness; clipping can happen when mixing positive
and negative values; with some of them getting multiplied with dark input
pixels).

Note: Multipliers bigger than 400h are glitchy (value 7FFh somehow converts
white pixels to dark gray).



## Default Array for GBA screen (scale by 1.5) (240x160 to 360x240)


This is using Pattern=011011b and Length=6 (minus 1). The array entries are
straight ahead, using pixels with full brightness, and merged pixels with half
brightness:

```
  0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h, N/A , N/A  <-- for 1st input pixel
  0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h, N/A , N/A  <-- for 2nd input pixel
  0000h,2000h,4000h,0000h,2000h,4000h, N/A , N/A  <-- for 3rd input pixel
  4000h,2000h,0000h,4000h,2000h,0000h, N/A , N/A  <-- for 4th input pixel
  0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h, N/A , N/A  <-- for 5th input pixel
  0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h,0000h, N/A , N/A  <-- for 6th input pixel
    |     |     |     |     |     |
    |                             '-----------------> to 6th output pixel
    '-----------------------------------------------> to 1st output pixel
```

For whatever reason, this is scaling by 6:4 with 6 output pixels (instead of
3:2 with 3 output pixels). Unknown if it's faster that way, or if there's some
other advantage.



## Default Array for NDS/DSi screens (scale by 1.25) (256x192 to 320x240)


This is using Pattern=01111b and Length=5 (minus 1). The array entries contain
positive and negative values, which might raise contrast between bright/dark
pixels:

```
  0000h,004Eh,011Dh,01E3h,01C1h, N/A , N/A , N/A  <-- for 1st input pixel
  0000h,FCA5h,F8D0h,F69Dh,F873h, N/A , N/A , N/A  <-- for 2nd input pixel
  0000h,0D47h,1E35h,2F08h,3B6Fh, N/A , N/A , N/A  <-- for 3rd input pixel
  4000h,3B6Fh,2F08h,1E35h,0D47h, N/A , N/A , N/A  <-- for 4th input pixel
  0000h,F873h,F69Dh,F8D0h,FCA5h, N/A , N/A , N/A  <-- for 5th input pixel
  0000h,01C1h,01E3h,011Dh,004Eh, N/A , N/A , N/A  <-- for 6th input pixel
    |     |     |     |     |
    |                       '-----------------------> to 5th output pixel
    '-----------------------------------------------> to 1st output pixel
```

Weirdly, the values for 2nd-5th output pixel values sum up to 3FDDh/3FAAh
(actually less, because the lower 4bit are ignored), making them a bit darker
than 1st output pixel.




# <a name="3dsvideotextureswizzling"></a>3DS Video Texture Swizzling




## Texture Swizzling


Morton Swizzling, or Z-order Swizzling is done by reading source pixels from a
scanline based bitmap in "Z-shaped" read-direction, and then storing that
pixels at continous VRAM addresses.

In the drawing below, each "Z" represents 2x2 pixels (arranged as a "Z" shape,
ie. upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right). On a larger scale, each
2x2 Z's are also forming a larger Z, and so on.

```
  Z/Z  /Z/Z
  .-' / .-'
  Z/Z/  Z/Z
      ..--'
  .--'
  Z/Z  /Z/Z
  .-' / .-'
  Z/Z/  Z/Z
```

This can improve cache hits for adjacent pixels. In a large bitmap, pixels in
adjacent scanlines are always located in separate cache entries. With the
swizzling, there is a better chance that they are in the same cache entry.



## Addressing


The swizzling does interleave the x/y address bits. On the 3DS hardware, data
is processed in units of 8 scanlines, so the interleave occurs on lower three
x/y bits only. For example, for 256x256 pixel data:

```
  Scanline-based bitmap -->  YyyyyyyyXxxxxxxx
  Swizzled texture      -->  YyyyyXxxxxyxyxyx
```



## Swizzling Hardware


The 3DS has some hardware for converting scanlines to swizzled textures:

```
  Y2R Registers (YUV-to-RGBA)
  L2B Registers (RGB-to-RGBA) (New3DS only)
  LGYFB Registers (GBA/NDS/DSi-to-3DS-Framebuffer)
```



## Swizzling Examples


Examples for scanline pixels before/after swizzling:

```
  Linear scanlines, 16x8 pixels:                    Linear lines, 8x8 pixels:

- [DSi XpertTeak (DSP)](ds.html#dsixpertteakdsp)
3DS software is commonly using the DSP to play music recordings in AAC format,
and reportedly there is something called DSP-ADPCM (maybe something similar to
IMA-ADPCM)?


```
 _______________________________ CSND Registers _______________________________
```


The sound hardware works very similar to NDS sound, see there for details about
PCM, IMA-ADPCM and PSG formats.

- [DS Sound](ds.html#dssound)
Differences are twice as many sound channels, some moved control bits, and
simplified volume control (without sound/panning/master volumes).

Unknown if/where BIAS exists on 3DS?



## 10103000h - Sound Control (R/W)


```
  0-15   CSND Master Volume (0..8000h) (8001h..FFFFh=replaced by 8000h) (R/W)

```

When bit31=1:

```
  10103400h+(N*20h).bit15   becomes R/W
  1010340Ch+(N*20h).bit31-2 becomes R/W
  10103800h+(N*10h).bit15   becomes R/W
  1010380Ch+(N*10h).bit31-0 becomes R/W
```


```
 ___________________________ CSND Channel Registers ___________________________

## 10103400h+(N\*20h) - Sound Channel 0-31: Control (parts W and R/W)

  16-31  Sample Rate (0..FFBEh; 0=Slowest, FFBEh=Fastest) (FFBFh..=Hangs)   (W)
```

PSG/Noise: Rectangular waves are supported on channel 8-13, noise on channel
14-15. Rectangular wave Duty is same as for NDS (but 32 samples long instead of
8 samples).

Sample rate is reportedly 4x higher than NDS:

```
  value = 67.027964MHz / samplerate
  uh, that value is NOT negative??? apparently wrong.
  XXX but what is NOISE frequency?
```



## 10103404h+(N\*20h) - Sound Channel 0-31: Output Volume (R/W)

## 10103414h+(N\*20h) - Sound Channel 0-31: Loop Restart Address (W)


```
  0-31  Physical Memory Address (unused for PSG/noise)
```

The R/W-ability is a mess: Start.bit2-31 are R/W (if enabled in
10103000h.bit31). Start.bit0-1 do also exist, but are write-only.
Restart.bit0-31 are write-only.



## 10103410h+(N\*20h) - Sound Channel 0-31: Total Size (W)


```
  0-26   Size in bytes (0..7FFFFFFh) (unused in manual mode)
  27-31  Unknown/Unused (0)
```

The size value is for the total size from Start to End (or Loop End if looped).
The total size (and size of looped part) semm to be required to be at least
10h. Hardware behaves quirky if the size of the looped part
(total-(restart-start)) is odd and/or(?) less than 10h. And, the quirkyness can
differ depending on whether CNT.bit10-11 is 1 or 3 (which is otherwise same).



## 10103418h+(N\*20h) - Sound Channel 0-31: Start IMA-ADPCM state (W)


```
  0-15   Initial PCM16 Value (Pcm16bit = -7FFFh..+7FFF) (not -8000h)
  16-22  Initial Table Index Value (Index = 0..88)
  23     Uh, reportedly MSB of above 7bit value ???
  ..     Unknown/Unused (0)
```

Equivalent to the IMA-ADPCM header from NDS samples (but, unlike as NDS, the
header must be manually written here; instead being located in the first four
sample bytes).



## 1010341Ch+(N\*20h) - Sound Channel 0-31: Loop Restart IMA-ADPCM state (W)


```
  0-15   Restart PCM16 Value (Pcm16bit = -7FFFh..+7FFF) (not -8000h)
  16-22  Restart Table Index Value (Index = 0..88)
  23     Uh, reportedly MSB of above 7bit value ???
  ..     Unknown/Unused (0)
  31     Reportedly ADPCM state reload at Loop Restart (1=Enable)
```

Allows to force the ADPCM state to the correct (pre-calculated) value upon
looping (or, with bit31=0, samples could drift if the last sample doesn't end
with exact same state as the first loop sample)...?

Uh, that's both weird... on NDS, the hardware did simply latch the correct
value automatically... is that really left unsupported on 3DS?


```
 ___________________________ CSND Capture Registers ___________________________
```


These are probably for left/right channel...

Maybe Capture 0 Left, and Capture 1 right?



## 10103800h+(N\*10h) - Sound Capture 0-1: Control (R/W)


```
  0      Capture Repeat        (0=Loop, 1=One-shot)
  1      Capture Format        (0=PCM16, 1=PCM8)
  2      Unknown ...? maybe something similar as on NDS
  2-14   Unused (0)
  15     Capture Start/Status  (0=Stop, 1=Start/Busy)  ;need 10103000h.bit31
  16-31  Unused (0)
```

There seems to be some extra delay at begin or end of capture: For one-shot,
the bit15=1 duration should depend on rate and length (but takes a bit longer
than it should).



## 10103804h+(N\*10h) - Sound Capture 0-1: Sample Rate (W)


```
  0-15   Sample Rate (0..FFBEh; 0=Slowest, FFBEh=Fastest) (FFBFh..FFFFh=Hangs)
  16-31  Unknown/unused (0)
```



## 1010380Ch+(N\*10h) - Sound Capture 0-1: Length (W)


```
  0-23   Length (in bytes) (1..FFFFFFh) (and oddly: 0=Same as 4)
  24-31  Unknown/unused (0)
```



## 1010380Ch+(N\*10h) - Sound Capture 0-1: Address (R/W)


```
  0-31   Address (in bytes) <--- This is R/W only if enabled in 10103000h.bit31
```

Capture works even if address and size are unaligned (even so for PCM16).


```
 _______________________________ CODEC Registers ______________________________

## 10145000h - CODEC\_SNDEXCNT, reportedly "Empty" uh? (R/W)


```
  0-5   DSP sound volume (00h..3Fh) (R/W)
  6-11  GBA sound volume (00h..3Fh) (R/W)

  30    Unknown, disonnant sound? (R/W)
  31    Master Enable Microphone (and Sound?)
```

Microphone requires bit31 set, and also one or both of bit15/bit12 set.

Teak BTDMP timing requires bit15 set (and is also affected by bit13).

GBA sound requires bit15 set, and nonzero volume in bit6-11.

Maybe some further bits here resemble DSi's SNDEXCNT...?

Cartridge detection is done using unencrypted 8-byte NTRCARD commands, 3DS
cartridges have ChipID.bit28=1, if so, command 3Eh is used to switch to 16-byte
CTRCARD mode.

Of these 16-byte commands, the first command/reply (82h) is unencrypted, used
to receive the header with an AES-encrypted encryption constant. The next
command/reply (83h) is encrypted using that constant, used to send a random
value. The following commands are encrypted using a combination of the original
constant and the random value.

```

On a lower level, the NTRCARD commands are working about as on NDS/DSi (with
hardcoded gaps between command and data). The CTRCARD commands are sending a
status byte instead of gaps (00h bytes when not ready, 01h when ready for data
transfer; the 3DS hardware does automatically wait for that status byte before
transferring data blocks). The data block is reportedly followed by a standard
CRC32 value across unencrypted data. However, cartridges do only seem to output
correct CRC's for command 82h/BFh. And, even then, the CRC doesn't actually
look like a standard CRC32, or maybe the CRC gets garbled by encryption or
status bytes?


The PROM is used for online games, it contains a 16-byte hex number (followed
by 30h-byte FFh-filled area).

Some cards do also have writeable NAND instead of ROM. The NAND is also
accessed via CTRCARD0 registers (not CTRCARD1), the NAND commands are still
unknown.


```
 __________________________ 3DS Cartridge Encryption __________________________
```


The encryption seed is initialized as follows:

```
  CardType = (ReplyFromCommandA0h AND 00000003h)
  send CTRCARD command 82h                      ;-receive NCSD[1000h..11FFh]
  AES.KEYX = as set by bootrom, keyslot 3Bh     ;\
  AES.KEYY = NCSD[1000h..100Fh]                 ; decrypt seed via AES-CCM
  AES.MAC  = NCSD[1020h..102Fh]                 ; (use big-endian input,
  AES.IV   = NCSD[1030h..103Bh]                 ; and little-endian output)
  if CardType=3 then AES.KEY = zerofilled       ;  <--dev card (keyslot 11h)
  AES.DATA.IN  = NCSD[1010h..101Fh]             ;
  ctrcard_seed[00h..0Fh] = AES.DATA.OUT         ;/
  CTRCARD_SECSEED = ctrcard_seed                ;\
  CTRCARD_SECCNT = CardType*100h+8004h          ; apply fixed seed
  wait until CTRCARD_SECCNT.bit14=1             ;/
  random64bit = whatever, can be zero, or same as fixed seed, or random
     cmdRand1 = REG_PRNG[0];
     cmdRand2 = REG_PRNG[4];
  send CTRCARD command 83h + random64bit        ;-send random64bit to card
  ctrcard_seed[00h..07h] = random64bit          ;-change LSBs of fixed seed
  CTRCARD_SECSEED = ctrcard_seed                ;\
  CTRCARD_SECCNT = CardType*100h+8004h          ; apply random seed
  wait until CTRCARD_SECCNT.bit14=1             ;/
  send further CTRCARD commands...              ;-get chip id, read data, etc.
```

The inner workings of the encryption hardware are unknown, it does probably
contain AES hardware with some built-in secret key/iv values. Cart dumping is
possible using the 3DS console hardware, there are also "sky3DS" flashcards
that can run pirate copies on 3DS consoles without needing exploits, but that's
kinda useless and works only for RSA signed official titles with region lock
(the game selection is done via buttons on the cartridge instead of file menu).

- [DS Cartridge I/O Ports](ds.html#dscartridgeioports)
```
  10164000h 2  REG_NTRCARD_MCNT    ;40001A0h 2  Gamecard ROM and SPI Control
  10164002h 2  REG_NTRCARD_MDATA   ;40001A2h 2  Gamecard SPI Bus Data/Strobe
  10164004h 4  REG_NTRCARD_ROMCNT  ;40001A4h 4  Gamecard bus timing/control

  10164010h 4  REG_NTRCARD_SEEDX_L ;40001B0h 4  Gamecard Encryption Seed 0 Low
  10164014h 4  REG_NTRCARD_SEEDY_L ;40001B4h 4  Gamecard Encryption Seed 1 Low
  10164018h 1  REG_NTRCARD_SEEDX_H ;40001B8h 2  Gamecard Encryption Seed 0 High
  1016401Ah 1  REG_NTRCARD_SEEDY_H ;40001BAh 2  Gamecard Encryption Seed 1 High
  1016401Ch 4  REG_NTRCARD_FIFO    ;4100010h 4  Gamecard bus 4-byte Data In (R)
```

These registers are usually used on ARM9 side. However, they are mapped to both
ARM11/ARM9, and do support IRQ/DMA on ARM11/ARM9 side (unlike most other
registers in that area, which support IRQ/DMA on ARM11 side only).

Note: ARM11-side CDMA 01h requires Port 1014010Ch, CFG11\_CDMA\_CNT.bit1=1.

  - 10004008h/10005008h 4   CTRCARD\_SECCNT    ;varies for CARD0/CARD1
  - 1000400Ch/1000500Ch 4   CTRCARD\_LOCK

## 10004000h/10005000h - CTRCARD\_CNT


```
  0-4   Timeout (0-16=1ms,2ms,4ms,8ms,..,64s; 17-31=64s, too; def=12=4s)  (R/W)
  5     Timeout Error      (0=Okay, 1=Error) (write 0 to ack)           (R/ack)
  6     Timeout Enable     (0=Disable, 1=Enable)                          (R/W)

  9     CRC Enable         (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (works for cmd 82h/BFh)  (R/W)
  10-14 Unused (0)
  15    DMA Enable         (0=Disable, 1=Enable DMA DRQs, each 8 words)   (R/W)
  16-19 Data Block size    (0-8=0,4,16,64,512,1K,2K,4K,8K; 9-15=8K, too)  (R/W)
  20-23 Unused (0)
  24-26 Transfer Clock     (0-5=67MHz div 4,5,6,8,10,16; 6-7=div16, too)  (R/W)
  27    Data-Word status   (0=Busy, 1=Ready/DRQ)                            (R)
  28    Reset Pin          (0=Low/Reset, 1=High/Release) (SET-ONCE)       (R/W)
  29    Transfer Direction (0=Read, 1=Write)                              (R/W)
  30    Interrupt Enable   (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (ARM9 IF.bit23/24)       (R/W)

```

With the above Transfer Clock settings, the clock (per byte) can range from
16.7MHz downto 4.2MHz.

Once reset pin is set high, it cannot be changed until controller is reset
(which can be done CFG9\_CARD\_POWER). Setting bit28 does work only when writing
bit31=0.



## 10004004h/10005004h - CTRCARD\_BLKCNT (R or R/W)


```
  0-14  Number of data blocks to read, minus 1   (0..7FFFh=1..8000h)      (R/W)

For CARD1 (10005008h): (R/W mask 9300h, without readonly mask)

```
  0-7   Unused (0)
  8-9   Key index (?)                                                     (R/W)

## 1000400Ch/1000500Ch - CTRCARD\_LOCK (R or R/W)


```
  0     Write-protect CNT.bit28, SECCNT.bit0-2 (0=No, 1=Lock) (SET-ONCE)  (R/W)
  1-31  Unused (0)
```



## 10004010h/10005010h - CTRCARD\_SECSEED (W)


```
  0-31  Encryption Seed, 4-word FIFO (16 bytes)
```

To apply the four most recent words written to SECSEED, write SECCNT.bit15=1,
then wait for SECCNT.bit14=1.

The seed is usually updated twice: Once after command 82h (using four seed
words from the cart header), and once after command 83h (with two seed words
changed to random values).



## 10004020h/10005020h - CTRCARD\_CMD (W)


```
  0-127 Command (128bit, aka 16 bytes, little endian, transferred MSB first)
```



## 10004030h/10005030h - CTRCARD\_FIFO (R) (maybe also for write-direction?)


```
  0-31  Data (from 8 word FIFO)
```

## Timers (ARM9 only)


10003000h ARM9

Same as GBA/NDS/DSi, except, reportedly faster & with stunning accuracy:

```
  "timers run at a frequency of 67,027,964.0 +/- 2^(-32) Hz"
```

which would be an estimated error of about +/- 1 cycle per century, or +/- 1
second per a few billions of years.

```

The spurious interrupt (3FFh) might appear in an interrupt handler if the
handler got triggered, but something (eg. another CPU) has cleared the IRQ flag
before the handler got a chance to process it.

## MPCore private memory region


The MPCore Private Memory Region contains additional ARM control registers
(additionally to the CP15 coprocessor registers). The 3DS does have this region
mapped at address 17E00000h and up.

# <a name="arm11mpcoresnoopcontrolunitscu"></a>ARM11 MPCore - Snoop Control Unit (SCU)




## Snoop Control Unit (SCU)


Below registers exists only once (not per CPU). However, the performance
counters are somewhat supposed to be used as two counters per CPU.



## 17E00000h - SCU Control Register (R/W)


The SCU Control Register enables the SCU and controls its behavior. It must be
accessed using a read-modify-write sequence.

```
  0     SCU Enable      (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
        (enable: maintain coherency between MP11 CPUs Level 1 data side caches)
        (in single CPU configuration, this bit has no effect and is always 0)
  1-4   Allow CPU0..3 to access SCU at 17E00000h..17E000FFh (0=No, 1=Yes)
  5-8   Allow CPU0..3 to access TMR at 17E00200h..17E005FFh (0=No, 1=Yes)
  9-12  Allow CPU0..3 to access IRQ at 17E00700h..17E00AFFh (0=No, 1=Yes)
  13    Report RAM Parity errors via parity error signals (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  14-31 Reserved SBZ
```

Bit1-4: There is a mechanism that prevents all bits being cleared at the same
time.

Bit13: Before enabling SCU parity checking, all SCU tag must be invalidated.

This register doesn't seem to allow to disable access to the Global Interrupt
Distributor at 17E01000h-17E01FFFh (however, the MMU can disable the whole
4Kbyte page).



## 17E00004h - SCU Configuration Register (R)


```
  0-1   Number of ARM11 CPU cores   (0..3 = 1,2,3,4 CPU's)
  2-3   Reserved SBZ
  4-7   CPU0..3 Symmetric/Asymmetric Multi-processing (0=SMP/coherent, 1=AMP)
  8-9   CPU0 Tag RAM cache size (0=16KB, 1=32KB, 2=64KB, 3=Reserved)
  10-11 CPU1 Tag RAM cache size (0=16KB, 1=32KB, 2=64KB, 3=Reserved)
  12-13 CPU2 Tag RAM cache size (0=16KB, 1=32KB, 2=64KB, 3=Reserved)
  14-15 CPU3 Tag RAM cache size (0=16KB, 1=32KB, 2=64KB, 3=Reserved)
  16-31 Reserved SBZ
```

Cache size 16KB/32KB/64KB implies 64/128/256 indexes per tag RAM accordingly.

On New3DS this is 00005013h (even in Old3DS mode). But changes to 00005003h
when using fastboot...?



## 17E00008h - SCU CPU Status Register (R/W)


```
  0-1   CPU0 status (0=Normal, 1=Reserved, 2=Dormant, 3=Powered-off)
  2-3   CPU1 status (0=Normal, 1=Reserved, 2=Dormant, 3=Powered-off)
  4-5   CPU2 status (0=Normal, 1=Reserved, 2=Dormant, 3=Powered-off)
  6-7   CPU3 status (0=Normal, 1=Reserved, 2=Dormant, 3=Powered-off)
  8-31  Reserved SBZ
```

Dormant mode and powered-off mode are controlled by an external power
controller.

SCU CPU Status Register bits indicate to the external power controller which
power domains can be powered down.

Before entering any other power mode than Normal, the MP11 CPU must set its
status field to signal to the SCU which mode it is about to enter (so that the
SCU can determine if it still can send coherency requests to the CPU). The MP11
CPU then executes a WFI entry instruction. When in WFI state, the PWRCTLOn bus
is enabled and signals to the power controller what it must do with power
domains.

The SCU CPU Status Register bits are used in conjunction with internal WFI
entry signals to generate PWRCTLOn output pins.

The SCU CPU Status Register bits can also be read by a CPU exiting low-power
mode to determine its state before executing its reset setup.

MP11 CPUs status fields take PWRCTLIn values at reset, except for nonpresent
CPUs.

For nonpresent CPUs writing to this field has no effect.



## 17E0000Ch - SCU Invalidate All Register (W)


```
  0-3   Invalidate CPU0 ways (bit0-3   = Way 0,1,2,3)  (0=No, 1=Invalidate)
  4-9   Invalidate CPU1 ways (bit4-9   = Way 0,1,2,3)  (0=No, 1=Invalidate)
  8-11  Invalidate CPU2 ways (bit8-11  = Way 0,1,2,3)  (0=No, 1=Invalidate)
  12-15 Invalidate CPU3 ways (bit12-15 = Way 0,1,2,3)  (0=No, 1=Invalidate)
  16-31 Reserved SBZ
```

Allows to invalidate the tag RAMs on a per CPU and per way basis. This
operation is atomic, that is, a write transfer to this address only terminates
when all the lines have been invalidated. This register reads as 0.

Uh, what is a "way"?



## 17E00010h - Performance Monitor Control Register (R/W)


```
  0      Enable bit for all counters     (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  1      Reset all count registers       (0=No, 1=Reset)
  2-7    Reserved SBZ
  8-15   Counter MN0..7 Interrupt Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  16-23  Counter MN0..7 Interrupt Flag (0=No, 1=Overflow/IRQ) ;write 1 to clear
  24-31  Reserved SBZ/RAZ
```



## 17E00014h - SCU Monitor Counter Events 0, bit0-31 (R/W)



## 17E00018h - SCU Monitor Counter Events 1, bit32-63 (R/W)


```
  0-7     EvCount0  Identifies the event for counter MN0
  8-15    EvCount1  Identifies the event for counter MN1
  16-23   EvCount2  Identifies the event for counter MN2 (if any)
  24-31   EvCount3  Identifies the event for counter MN3 (if any)
  48-55   EvCount6  Identifies the event for counter MN6 (if any)
  56-63   EvCount7  Identifies the event for counter MN7 (if any)
  32-39   EvCount4  Identifies the event for counter MN4 (if any)
  40-47   EvCount5  Identifies the event for counter MN5 (if any)
```

Event source number definitions:

New3DS has eight counters (even in Old3DS mode).




# <a name="arm11mpcoretimerandwatchdog"></a>ARM11 MPCore - Timer and Watchdog




## Timer and Watchdog


Below registers are for the LOCAL CPU core (the other CPU cores have their own
registers, mapped at the same address).



## 17E00600h - MPCore Timer0 Reload Value (R/W)



## 17E00620h - MPCore Timer1/Watchdog Reload Value (R/W)


```
  0-31  Reload Value
```

The Reload value is copied to the Counter in two situations:

1) When the Counter decrements to zero (with Auto-reload enabled).

2) When writing to the Reload register (in watchdog mode this is the only way
to refresh the watchdog, and to prevent it from resetting the CPU).



## 17E00604h - MPCore Timer0 Counter Value (R/W)



## 17E00624h - MPCore Timer1/Watchdog Counter Value (R/W) (R in watchdog mode)


```
  0-31  Counter Value (decrementing)
```

If the MP11 CPU belonging to the timer is in debug state, the counter does not
decrement until the MP11 CPU returns to non debug state.



## 17E00608h - MPCore Timer0 Control Register (R/W)



## 17E00628h - MPCore Timer1/Watchdog Control Register (R/W)


```
  0     Timer Enable     (0=Stop, 1=Enable/Decrement)
  1     Auto-reload      (0=One-shot, stop at zero, 1=Auto-reload at zero)
  2     Interrupt Enable (0=Disable, 1=Trigger Interrupt ID 29/30 at zero)
  3     Timer0: Reserved      (0=Timer, fixed, always 0) (R)
  3     Timer1: Watchdog mode (0=Timer, 1=Watchdog)      (R or R/W)
          Note: Bit3 can be cleared via 17E00634h only
  4-7   Reserved (0)
  8-15  Prescaler (0..255 = CPU_CLK/2 divided by 1..256)
  16-31 Reserved (0)
```



## 17E0060Ch - MPCore Timer0 Interrupt Status (R/ack)



## 17E0062Ch - MPCore Timer1/Watchdog Interrupt Status (R/ack)


```
  0     Event flag (counter reached zero)  (0=No, 1=Event)  ;write 1 to clear
  1-31  Reserved
```

If the timer interrupt is enabled, Interrupt ID 29/30 is set as Pending in the
Interrupt Distributor after the event flag is set.



## 17E00630h - MPCore Timer1/Watchdog Reset Sent Register (R/ack)


```
  0     Reset flag  (0=Normal, 1=Reset caused by Watchdot)  ;write 1 to clear
  1-31  Reserved
```



## 17E00634h - W - MPCore Timer1/Watchdog Disable Register


```
  0-31  Key (write 12345678h, then write 87654321h to disable watchdog)
```

Switches the watchdog back to Timer mode (ie. clears bit3 in Control Register).



## Calculating timer intervals


- The timer interval is calculated using the following equation:
    - (PRESCALER\_value+1)\*(Reload\_value+1)\*2 / CPU\_CLK\_frequency
- This equation can be used to calculate the period between two events out of
- the timers and the watchdog time-out time.

Uh, doesn't that mean that reload occurs on UNDERFLOW (not on ZERO)...?




# <a name="arm11mpcoreinterruptconfiguration"></a>ARM11 MPCore - Interrupt Configuration




## Distributed Interrupt Controller (for Interrupt Configuration)


These registers are mostly used for interrupt configuration (and for internally
maintaining an list of pending/active interrupts).

```
  -- Most of these registers exists only once (not per CPU) --
```

Except, the Priority for Software Interrupts 00h-0Fh can be configured per
LOCAL CPU. And, the Pending and Active flags do \<internally> exist for
each CPU (for Software Interrupts 00h-0Fh, they do even exists for "From each
CPU to each CPU"). However, reading the Pending/Active/Priority flags doesn't
fully represent all of the internal per-CPU states.



## 17E01000h - Interrupt Distributor Control Register (R/W)


```
  0     Global Interrupt Controller Enable    (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  1-31  Reserved
```

If bit0=0, no interrupts at all are sent to the CPU interrupt interfaces.



## 17E01004h - Interrupt Controller Type Register (R)

```

Enable means that pending IRQs will be transmitted to the targeted CPUs.

The enable bit, when set to 0, does not prevent an edge-triggered interrupt
from becoming Pending.

The enable bit, when set to 0, does prevent a level sensitive interrupt from
becoming Pending only if asserted by the hardware pin, INT.

Note: If an interrupt is Pending or Active when its enable bit is set to 0, it
remains in its current state.

## 17E01300h..17E0131Fh - Active Bit Registers (256 x 1bit) (R)


```
  0-31   Interrupt 00h-1Fh is active on local CPU        (0=No, 1=Active)
  32-255 Interrupt 20h-FFh is active on one or more CPUs (0=No, 1=Active)
```

Active means that the interrupt is being processed on at least one MP11 CPU.



## 17E01400h..17E014FFh - Interrupt Priority Registers (256 x 8bit) (R/W)


The priority determines which interrupt will show up next in the interrupt
interface registers. And, the interface registers can be used to manually
disable lower priority interrupts during 'critical sections'. And, while
processing an interrupt, the hardware will automatically disable interrupts
with same or lower priority (optionally, the "Binary Point" feature allows to
ignore the LSBs of the priorioty, eg. ignoring the lowest bit with allow to
also disable interrupts with slightly higher priority).

```
  0-127     Interrupt 00h-0Fh Priority for local CPU (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio)
  128-231   Interrupt 10h-1Ch Priority for what?     (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio)
  232-255   Interrupt 1Dh-1Fh Priority for local CPU (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio)
  256-2047  Interrupt 20h-FFh Priority for all CPUs  (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio)
```

Priority values are 00h=Highest... E0h=Lowest, or F0h=None (same as interrupt
disabled).

When multiple Pending interrupts have the same priority, the selected interrupt
is the one with lowest ID. If there are multiple Pending software interrupts
with the same ID, the lowest MP11 CPU source is selected.



## 17E01800h..17E018FFh - Interrupt CPU Targets Registers (256 x 8bit) (R/W)


These registers store the list of MP11 CPUs for which an interrupt can be
Pending. Interrupt target registers are ignored in cases of software triggered
interrupts.

```
  0-231     Interrupt 00h-1Ch Target (fixed 00h) (see 17E01F00h instead)  (-)
  232-255   Interrupt 1Dh-1Fh Target (fixed 01h/02h/04h/08h for CPU0..3)  (R)
  256-2047  Interrupt 20h-FFh Target (bit0-3=CPU0..3, bit4-7=SBZ)       (R/W)
```

Modifying a CPU target list has no influence on a Pending or Active interrupt,
but takes effect on a subsequent assertion of the interrupt.



## 17E01C00h..17E01C3Fh - Interrupt Configuration Registers (256 x 2bit) (R/W)


Interrupt Configuration Registers define the assertion condition and the
software model of each interrupt.

```
  0-31     Interrupt 00h-0Fh Condition (can be 2,3) (always rising-edge)
  32-57    Interrupt 10h-1Ch Condition (always 0)
  58-61    Interrupt 1Dh-1Eh Condition (always 2) (always N-N, rising-edge)
  62-63    Interrupt 1Fh     Condition (always 0) (ignored, always low active)
  64-511   Interrupt 20h-FFh Condition (can be 0,1,2,3)
```

Interrupt line encodings for bits 1 and 0:

```
  00h = N-N software model, level high active
  01h = 1-N software model, level high active
  02h = N-N software model, rising edge sensitive
  03h = 1-N software model, rising edge sensitive
```

The N-N and 1-N models are relevant only if more than one CPU is configured as
Target:

```
  1-N model: An interrupt that is taken on any CPU clears the Pending status
    on all CPUs.
  N-N model: All CPUs receive the interrupt independently. The Pending status
    is cleared only for the CPU that takes it, not for the other CPUs. The N-N
    model has been deprecated in the latest interrupt controller architecture.
```

Unknown how 1-N and N-N differ for Interrupt 00h-0Fh (it's said that each CPU
has it's own pending flags for 00h-0Fh, so the model should be always "1-1").

```
  Obscure Notes:
  - With the 1-N software model, the nIRQ input is asserted on all CPUs
    configured in the CPU Targets Register. Uh, but Interrupt 1Fh is fixed?
  - If more than one of these CPUs reads the Interrupt Acknowledge Register
    at the same time, they can all acknowledge the same interrupt. The
    interrupt service routine must ensure that only one of them tries to
    process the interrupt, with the others returning after writing the ID to
    the End of Interrupt Register. Uh, does that apply to nIRQ only? Or to
    all IRQs?
```



## 17E01D00h..17E01D1Fh - Interrupt Line Level Registers (256 x 1bit) (R)


```
  0-31    Dummy line level bits for Internal IRQ 00h..1Fh (always 0)
  32-255  Interrupt line level for External IRQ 20h..FFh  (0=Low, 1=High)
```



## 17E01F00h - Software Interrupt Register (W)


```
  0-9     Interrupt ID (0..FFh? or 0..0Fh/1Fh?) (100h..1FFh=Reserved/ignored)
  10-15   SBZ
  16-19   Send the interrupt to CPU0..3 (0=No, 1=Yes) ;used only if Bit24-25=0
  20-23   SBZ
  24-25   Target list mode (0=Bit16-19, 1=Other CPUs, 2=Local CPU, 3=Reserved)
  26-31   SBZ
```

This can be used to trigger an interrupt (identified with its ID) to a list of
MP11 CPUs.




# <a name="arm11mpcoreinterrupthandling"></a>ARM11 MPCore - Interrupt Handling




## CPU Interrupt Interface Registers (for Interrupt Handling)


Below registers are for the LOCAL CPU core (the other CPU cores have their own
registers, mapped at the same address).



## 17E00100h - CPU Interface Control Register (R/W)


```
  0     Interrupt Enable for local CPU   (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  1-31  Reserved
```

When disabled: External nIRQ input is still working (and, in that case, nIRQ
should be handled directly; without using the disabled ACK/EOI registers).



## 17E00104h - Priority Mask Register (R/W)


The priority mask is used to prevent interrupts from being sent to the MP11
CPU. The CPU Interface asserts an interrupt request to an MP11 CPU if the
priority of the highest Pending interrupt sent by the Interrupt Distributor is
strictly higher than the mask set in the Priority Mask Register.

```
  0-3  Unused SBZ
  4-7  Priority Mask value
            NOTE: This is a 4bit COMPARE value (not an AND-mask)
               0xF Interrupts with priority 0x0-0xE are not masked.
               0x0 All interrupts are masked.
  8-31 Unused SBZ
```



## 17E00108h - Binary Point Register (R/W)


The Binary Point Register is used to determime whether a new interrupt
pre-empts a currently Active one, using only part, or none of the priority
level.

```
  0-2   Binary Point (see below)
  3-31  Reserved
```

Binary point bit values assignment:

```
  03h = All bits4,5,6,7 of priority are compared for pre-emption
  04h = Only bit5,6,7   of priority are compared for pre-emption
  05h = Only bit6,7     of priority are compared for pre-emption
  06h = Only bit7       of priority is compared for pre-emption
  07h = No bits compared, no pre-emption is performed (no nested IRQs)
  00h,01h,02h = Same as 03h
```

This is related to the "Running Priority Register" (see there for details).



## 17E0010Ch - Interrupt Acknowledge (ACK) Register (R)


```
  0-9     Interrupt ID          (00h..FFh, or 3FFh=None)
  10-12   Source for ID=00h-0Fh (0..3=CPU0..3, or always 0 for ID=10h-3FFh)
  13-31   Unused (0)
```

Reading returns the ID of the next pending interrupt with highest priority, and
automatically switches the interrupt from pending state to active state
(indicating that it is being processed). The CPU should then process the
interrupt, and, thereafer, use End of Interrupt register (to indicate that
processing is done).



## 17E00110h - End of Interrupt (EOI) Register (W)


```
  0-31    Same format as Interrupt Acknowledge Register (see there)
```

Writing clears the Active flag for the corresponding interrupt, indicating that
interrupt processing is done. The written value should be same as the
(memorized) value from the Interrupt Acknowledge Register.



## 17E00114h - Running Priority Register (R)


Indicates the priority of the currently processed interrupt (the last
acknowledged and not yet completed interrupt on the local CPU core).

```
  0-3  Reserved SBZ
  4-7  Priority (0=Highest .. 14=lowest, 15=None/No interrupt being processed)
  8-31 Reserved
```

All interrupts with same or lower priority are automatically disabled until
finishing the current interrupt (by writing to End of Interrupt register).

Optionally, the "Binary Point Register" allows to ignore the priority LSB(s)
when comparing the new Interrupt's priority with the currently "Running
Priority" (for example, ignoring the lower two bits would cause an interrupt
with priority=5 to also disable slighly higher priority interrupts with
priority=6..7).



## 17E00118h - Highest Pending Interrupt Register (R)


```
  0-31    Same format as Interrupt Acknowledge Register (see there)
```

Same as Interrupt Acknowledge Register, except that reading doesn't make the
corresponding interrupt Active.

Uh, and supposedly doesn't clear its Pending state... or does it?




# <a name="arm11mpcoredistributedinterruptcontrollerblurb"></a>ARM11 MPCore Distributed Interrupt Controller (Blurb)




## 10.1.1 Distributed Interrupt Controller clock frequency


The Distributed Interrupt Controller logic is clocked at half the frequency of
the MPCore CPUs because of power and area considerations. Reducing clock speed
reduces dynamic power consumption. The lower clock speed requires less
pipelining in the design. This means that the overall impact of the reduced
clock speed on the Distributed Interrupt Controller is kept to a minimum.

Note

As a consequence, the minimum pulse width of signals driving external interrupt
lines is two CPU clock cycles.



## 10.2 Terminology - From point of view of an MP11 CPU, an interrupt can be:


```
  Inactive: An Inactive interrupt is one that is nonasserted, or which in a
    multi-processing environment has been completely processed by that MP11
    CPU but can still be either Pending or Active in some of the MP11 CPUs to
    which it is targeted, and so might not have been cleared at the interrupt
    source.
  Pending: A Pending interrupt is one that has been asserted, and for which
    processing has not started on that MP11 CPU.
  Active: An Active interrupt is one that has been started on that MP11 CPU,
    but processing is not complete.
```

An interrupt can be Pending and Active at the same time. This can happen in the
case of edge triggered interrupts, when the interrupt is asserted while the
MP11 CPU has not finished handling the first occurrence. For level-sensitive
interrupts it can only happen if software triggers it. See Interrupt
Configuration Registers, 0xC00-0xC3C on page 10-17.

```
  Pre-emption: An Active interrupt can be pre-empted when a new interrupt of
    higher priority interrupts MP11 CPU interrupt processing. For the purpose
    of this document, an Active interrupt can be running if it is actually
    being processed, or pre-empted.
```

The Distributed Interrupt Controller consists of:

Interrupt Distributor:

The Interrupt Distributor handles interrupt detection and interrupt
prioritization.

CPU interrupt interfaces:

There is one CPU interrupt interface per MP11 CPU. The MP11 CPU interrupt
interfaces handle interrupt acknowledgement, interrupt masking, and interrupt
completion acknowledgement.



## 10.3 Interrupt Distributor


The Interrupt Distributor centralizes all interrupt sources for the ARM11
MPCore processor before dispatching the highest priority ones to each
individual MP11 CPU.

All interrupt sources are identified by a unique ID. All interrupt sources have
their own configurable priority and list of targeted CPUs, that is, a list of
CPUs to which the interrupt is sent when triggered by the Interrupt
Distributor.

Note

nFIQ interrupts are not handled by the Distributed Interrupt Controller so that
nFIQ interrupt input pins are directly routed to their respective CPU.

Interrupt sources are of the following types:


## Interprocessor interrupts (IPI)


Each MP11 CPU has private interrupts, ID0-ID15, that can only be triggered by
software. These interrupts are aliased so that there is no requirement for a
requesting MP11 CPU to determine its own ID when it deals with IPIs. The
priority of an IPI depends on the receiving CPU, not the sending CPU.


## Private timer and/or watchdog interrupts.


Each MP11 CPU has its own private timer and watchdog that can generate
interrupts, using ID29 and ID30.


## A legacy nIRQ pin


In legacy IRQ mode the legacy nIRQ pin, on a per CPU basis, bypasses the
Interrupt Distributor logic and directly drives interrupt requests into the
MP11 CPU. In legacy IRQ mode, if bit [0] of the CPU Interface Control Register
is 0, then no interrupts are raised based on input from the Interrupt
Distributor. If bit [0] is 1, then all interrupts are received from the
Interrupt Distributor.

When an MP11 CPU uses the Distributed Interrupt Controller (rather than the
legacy pin in the legacy mode) by enabling its own CPU interface, the legacy
nIRQ pin is treated like other interrupt lines and uses ID31.


## Hardware interrupts


Hardware interrupts are triggered by programmable events on associated
interrupt input lines. MP11 CPUs can support up to 224 interrupt input lines.
The interrupt input lines can be configured to be edge sensitive (posedge) or
level sensitive (high level). Hardware interrupts start at ID32.



## 10.3.1 Interrupt Distributor overview


The Interrupt Distributor holds the list of Pending interrupts for each CPU,
and then selects the highest priority interrupt before issuing it to the CPU
interface. Interrupts of equal priority are resolved by selecting the lowest
ID.

The Interrupt Distributor consists of a register-based list of interrupts,
their priorities and activation requirements (CPU targets). In addition the
state of each interrupt on each CPU is held in the associated state storage.

The prioritization logic is physically duplicated for each CPU to enable the
selection of the highest priority for each CPU.

The Interrupt Distributor holds the central list of interrupts, processors and
activation information, and is responsible for triggering software interrupts
to processors.

The CPU Interface acknowledges interrupts and changes interrupt priority masks.


The Interrupt Distributor transmits to the CPU interrupt interfaces their
highest Pending interrupt. It receives back the information that the interrupt
has been acknowledged, and can then change the status of the corresponding
interrupt. The CPU Interface also transmits End of Interrupt Information (EOI),
which enables the Interrupt Distributor to update the status of this interrupt
from Active to Inactive.

                     Interrupt List                                 each CPU
```



## 10.3.2 Behavior of the Interrupt Distributor


When the Interrupt Distributor detects an interrupt assertion, it sets the
status of the interrupt for the targeted MP11 CPUs to Pending. Level-triggered
interrupts cannot be marked as Pending if they are already Active for at least
one MP11 CPU.

For each MP11 CPU the prioritization and selection block searches for the
Pending interrupt with the highest priority. This interrupt is then sent with
its priority to the CPU Interface.



The CPU Interface returns information to the Distributor when the CPU
acknowledges (Pending to Active transition) or clears an interrupt (Active to
Inactive transition). With the given interrupt ID, the Interrupt Distributor
updates the status of this interrupt according to the information sent by the
CPU Interface.

When an interrupt is triggered by the Software Interrupt Register or the
Set-pending Register, the status of that interrupt for the targeted CPU or CPUs
is set to Pending. This interrupt then has the same behavior as a hardware
interrupt. The distributor does not differentiate between software and hardware
triggered interrupts.

# <a name="armvfpfloatingpointregisters"></a>ARM VFP Floating Point Registers




## Floating point Registers


Registers S0-S31 can contain Single-precision float values, or 32bit Integers
(for conversion to/from float format), or a pair of two Single-precision
registers can contain one Double-precision float value.

```
  Scalar Bank       Vector bank 1       Vector bank 2       Vector bank 3
  S1:S0    D0       S9:S8    D4         S17:S16  D8         S25:S24  D12
  S2:S3    D1       S11:S10  D5         S19:S18  D9         S27:S26  D13
  S5:S4    D2       S13:S12  D6         S21:S20  D10        S29:S28  D14
  S7:S6    D3       S15:S14  D7         S23:S22  D11        S31:S30  D15
```

The VFP supports "Scalar" and "Vector" modes (and a mixed "Vector/Scalar"
mode).

The "Vector" mode can perform simultaneous operations on up to 8 singles, or up
to 4 doubles (via Vector LEN and STRIDE selected in FPSCR register).

The registers are organized in "banks", and vectors cannot cross banks (eg.
using operand S23 with LEN=3, STRIDE=2 would use registers S23,S17,S19).



## Scalar Mode, Fd=Fm \<op> Fn


The "Scalar" mode performs operations on 1 single or double. This done in any
of the following situations:

- - When FPSCR register is set to Vector LEN=1 (and STRIDE=1), or
- - When Destination is S0..S7 or D0..D3 (scalar bank), or
- - When using FCMP comparision opcodes, or
- - When using FCVT or FxxTOxx conversion opcodes, or
- - When using FMxxRxx register transfer opcodes, or
- - When using FLDxx/FSTxx load/store (whereof, FLDM/FSTM can transfer multiple
    - registers in vector-like fashion; regardless of LEN/STRIDE settings)



## Vector Mode, Fd[LEN]=Fm[LEN] \<op> Fn[LEN]


The vector mode does merely perform the selected operation on all array
elements, this is correct for cases like Vector+Vector addition, but incorrect
for Vector\*Vector multiplication (to get the final result one must manually
compute the sum of the results).

- - When FPSCR register is set to Vector LEN=2..8 (and STRIDE=1..2), and
- - When Source and Destination are S8..S31 or D4..D15 (vector banks), and
- - When using FADD, FSUB, FDIV, FCPY, FABS, FNEG, FSQRT, or FxMxx multiply



## Mixed Mode, Fd[LEN]=Fm \<op> Fn[LEN]


This allows to add/multiply/etc. all elements of a vector by a scalar value.
This is done when combining vectors operands with the following:

- - When Source operand Fm is S0..S7 or D0..D3 (scalar bank), and
- - othersise same conditions as for Vector mode



## Integer Format (S0..S31 aka I0..I31)


```
  31-0   Integer (signed or unsigned, depending on FxxTOxx opcode)
```

The VFP can't do integer maths, however, one can load/store integer values in
S0..S31, and then use the FxxTOxx opcodes to convert integers to/from float
format. The integers are always 32bit (no matter if converting Single/Double
precision float values).



## Single Precision Registers (float1.8.23) (S0..S31)


```
  31     1bit  Sign (0=Positive, 1=Negative)
  30-23  8bit  Exponent (01h..FEh=for 2^(N-7Fh), or 00h/FFh=Special)
  22-0   23bit Fraction (0..7FFFFFh)
```



## Double Precision Registers (float1.11.52) (D0..D15)


```
  63     1bit  Sign (0=Positive, 1=Negative)
  62-52  11bit Exponent (001h..7FEh=for 2^(N-3FFh), or 000h/7FFh=Special)
  51-0   52bit Fraction (0..FFFFFFFFFFFFFh)
```



## Exponent 01h..FEh (Single) or 001h..7FEh (Double):


```
  Sign * 2^(exponent-7Fh) * (1.fraction)    ;Single
  Sign * 2^(exponent-3FFh) * (1.fraction)   ;Double
```


## Exponent 00h (Single) or 000h (Double), aka Small Numbers and Zero:


```
  Sign * 2^(-7Eh) * (0.fraction)            ;Single
  Sign * 2^(-3FEh) * (0.fraction)           ;Double
  The above includes 0 being encoded as fraction=0, the sign bit is ignored
  for cases like "compare +/-0", but the sign is used for "divide by +/-0".
  Small numbers in 0.fraction format may require extra clock cycles for
  counting leading zeroes; unknown if that problem does actually exist on
  ARM hardware, however, the "flush to zero" feature (see FPSCR.bit24) can
  be used to avoid that issue; 0.fraction will be then replaced by 0.000.
```


## Exponent FFh (Single) or 7FFh (Double), aka NaN's and Infinite:


```
  fraction=000000h          or 0000000000000h                 +/-Infinite
  fraction=000001h..3FFFFFh or 0000000000001h..7FFFFFFFFFFFFh +/-Signaling NaNs
  fraction=400000h          or 8000000000000h                 +/-Default NaN
  fraction=400000h..7FFFFFh or 8000000000000h..FFFFFFFFFFFFFh +/-Quite NaNs
  NaNs (Not a Number) can be used for abstract non-numeric expressions; this
  isn't useful for normal maths, but may be useful if a database contains
  entries like "Weight=UNKNOWN". If so, one may handle the NaN before passing
  it to the floating point unit, or otherwise the hardware will either trigger
  an exception (Signaling NaNs) or leave the NaN unchanged (Quite NaNs),
  eg. "UNKNOWN*2+3 = UNKNOWN", or replace it by Default NaN (if FPSCR.bit25=1).
  Different NaNs can be compared using integer comparisons, float comparisions
  of NaNs have "unordered" results (even when comparing a NaN with itself).
```



## Multiply Note


When multiplying vector\*vector, the hardware does merely multiply the
components (without computing the sum of the multiply results). To get sum, one
could use FMUL and several FADD's with different strides. Or better, for
multiple vector\*vector multiplications, use FMUL and several FMAC's with source
data rearranged as so:

```
  FMUL (X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X)*(X,X,X,X,X,X,X,X)
  FMAC (Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y)*(Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y,Y)
  FMAC (Z,Z,Z,Z,Z,Z,Z,Z)*(Z,Z,Z,Z,Z,Z,Z,Z)
  FMAC (W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W)*(W,W,W,W,W,W,W,W)
```

Ie. in that case, the 1st "vector" contains the X components from up to eight
(X,Y,Z,W) vectors.

## Nocash syntax


The useless {S|D} suffixes are ommitted, the weird {X} suffix is kept used to
preserve weirdness.

Fancy {} brackets are omitted, LDM/STM must use square [Rn] brackets, the
register list in LDM/STM is specified as Fx-Fz (rather than Fx,Fy,Fz).

All FMxxxx opcodes are renamed to FMOV{LSW|MSW}.



## Weird STM/LDM{X} - for registers with unknown precision


The weird {X} mode is same as {D}, but with offset.bit0=1 (ie. with offs=3..33
instead of 2..32; and thereby actually transferring an unused dummy word).

The weird {X} mode is/was intended for registers with unknown content (eg. when
pushing/popping registers without knowing if they contain integer/single/double
precision values; which might be a problem with internal accumulators in the
VFP unit).

The weird {X} mode was declared as "deprecated in ARMv6" in DDI 0100I, but
later re-declared as required for "compatibility with future VFP
implementations" in DDI 360F. However, unknown if there are/were/will be any
such implementations that do require it.

For now, it should be best to use {D} mode instead of weird {X}. Probably even
{S} should also work the same (if the endianess-based word-order doesn't
matter).




# <a name="3dsfilesemmcpartitions"></a>3DS Files - eMMC Partitions

## Encryption


The NAND file system is encrypted using AES-CTR. The keyslot used for each
partition is determined by the NCSD partition FS type and encryption type.


NAND sectors which were never written to contain plaintext 00h or FFh bytes.


None of the NAND partitions are normally accessible from the ARM11, except for
twlp. CTR/TWL NAND FS can only be accessed when the exheader access control
descriptor for those are enabled. Normally the CTR/TWL NAND descriptors are
never enabled for retail ARM11 CXI processes. The ARM11 can only access
"nand:/rw/" mounted as the nandrw archive, and "nand:/ro/" mounted as the
nandro archive below.



## eMMC 4000h (on some consoles) (empty 00h-filled on others)


On some 3DS systems (such as 3DS XL), there's a plaintext FAT16 boot record
located at NAND offset 0x4000. This block does not exist for launch-day 3DS
systems. This is the only plaintext block for this "partition".

That is, a 200h-byte VBR sector with string FAT16 (the actual FAT, Root, and
Data sectors don't exist... and the Data clusters would probably overlap other
partitions).



## eMMC 12C00h (aka Sector 96h) (New3DS only) (empty FFh-filled on Old3DS)


```
  000h 10h   Used for generating Key X values for keyslot 15h and 18h
  010h 10h   Used for generating Key X values for keyslot 16h and 19h-1Fh ;v9.6
  020h 1E0h  Further constants (unused)
```

This 200h-byte sector contains New3DS keys, this entire sector is encrypted via
AES-ECB with a console-unique keyX+keyY. The keyX+keyY for this is generated by
the New3DS arm9bin-loader. Once the arm9bin-loader finishes decrypting this
data, the keyX+keyY in the keyslot are then cleared, then the memory used for
generating the keydata is disabled (after it finishes using it for TWL key
init).

The decrypted sector is same on all New3DS consoles (except, retail-vs-debug
are different):

```
  Decrypted 200h-bytes on Retail: 07h,29h,44h,38h, ..., 13h,63h,CFh,8Fh
  Decrypted 200h-bytes on Dev:    Unknown...
```



## 3DS CTR partition


The structure of nand/title appears to be exactly the same as SD, except
savegames are stored under the nand/data/\<ID0>/sysdata directory instead.
The sub-directory name under nand/data is the SHA256 hash over the movable.sed
keyY. This nand/data/\<ID0> directory is the NAND equivalent of the
"sdmc/Nintendo 3DS/\<ID0>/\<ID1>" directory, however the data
contained here is stored in cleartext. The movable.sed keyY is only used for
AES MACs for nand/data/\<ID0>. The nand/data/\<ID0>/extdata directory
contains the shared extdata, and is structured exactly the same way as SD
extdata.



## DSi TWL partition


The structure of these TWL partitions is mostly the same as DSi, except tickets
are stored in the CTR FAT FS. The twlp partition is exactly the same as DSi.
The structure of twln/title is exactly the same as CTR NAND/SD, except the .cmd
file is a cleartext file (this is likely a dummy file). The data directory
under system titles' /title directory does not exist, this likely only exists
for DSiWare. The directory names titleID-High used under twln/title is from
DSi.



## 3ds:\\_\_journal.nn\_ (with system attribute)


```
  00000h 12    ID "LIAFEFAS1",0,0,0  (aka 1SAFEFAIL backwards)
  0000Ch 4     Total Filesize/200h (can be C0h=18000h or E0h=1C000h)
  00010h 4     Bytes 83h,3Eh,5Ch,89h or 86h,03h,0Fh,D7h (timestamp or so?)
  00014h 4     Value 01h (whatever)
  00018h ..    Zero
  001DCh 4     Value 03h (whatever)
  001E0h 20h   Whatever (maybe SHA256 on something) (3Fh,5Ch,AEh,20h,..)
  00200h 4     Value 06h (whatever)
  00204h 1F4h  Zero
  00400h 200h  Some FAT Directory sector with short filenames
  00600h 200h  Some FAT Allocation sector with FAT16 entries
  00800h 7C00h Zero
 Below can be at 08400h..17FFFh, or alternately at 04400h..1BFFFh:
  08400h 200h  Some FAT Directory sector with short filenames
  08600h 200h  Some FAT Allocation sector with FAT16 entries
  08800h F800h Random garbage, or encrypted sectors, or whatever
```

Unknown purpose, might be some debug log, or undo-info for handling incomplete
FAT writes to the 3DS partition? If so, unknown if it's important to
update/delete the journal file after manually changing FAT contents (to prevent
the OS from corrupting/undoing the manual changes).

Unknown if there is a list of sector numbers for the 200h-byte sectors (maybe
that list exists, but gets zerofilled after completion?), unknown why there are
only short filenames (normally there should be also long/lowercase names).




# <a name="3dsfilesncsdformat"></a>3DS Files - NCSD Format



NCSD format is used for internal eMMC storage & for 3DS ROM cartridges. The
NCSD can contain up to 8 partitions.

- For eMMC, the partitions are:
  - Part Type     Content
  - 0    MBR      DSi MBR (with two FAT filesystems, FAT16+FAT12)
  - 1    GBA-SAVE GBA savegame (temporary storage, used on power-off in GBA mode)
  - 2    FIRM     Firmware partition (firm0)
  - 3    FIRM     Firmware partition (firm1) (backup copy, same as above)
  - 4    MBR      3DS MBR (with one FAT filesystem, FAT16)
  - 5-7  -        Unused
- For 3DS ROM Cartridges (aka CCI images), the partitions are:
  - Part Type     Content
  - 0    NCCH     Executable Content (CXI)
  - 1    NCCH     E-Manual (CFA)
  - 2    NCCH     Download Play Child container (CFA) (if any)
  - 3-5  -        Unused
  - 6    NCCH     New3DS System Update Data (CFA) (if any) ;\aka firmware updates
  - 7    NCCH     Old3DS System Update Data (CFA)          ;/



## Blurb


There are two known specialisations of the NCSD container format:

```
  - The CTR Cart Image (CCI) format (CCI is the format of game ROM images)
  - The 3DS' raw NAND format
```

CTR System Update (CSU) is a variant of CCI, where the only difference is in
the file extension (uh, that is the file extension of a ROM-image that needs to
be copied to a dev flashcard or so?). This is used with developer System
Updates and associated Tools.

The format of partitions can be determined from the partition FS flags
(normally these are zero for CCI/CSU NCSD Images) (uh, what/where is "FS
flags"?).



## NCSD header


```
  000h 100h    RSA-2048 SHA-256 signature of the NCSD header (including MBR!)
  100h 4       ID "NCSD"
  104h 4       Size of the NCSD image (in media units)
  108h 8  ?    Media ID
  110h 8*1     Partitions Type  (0=NCCH or Unused, 1=MBR, 3=FIRM, 4=GBA-SAVE)
  118h 8*1     Partitions Crypt (0=NCCH or Unused, 1=DSi, 2=3DS, 3=New3DS)
  120h 8*(4+4) Partitions Offset & Size (in media units)
 For eMMC:
  160h 25h Zerofilled
  185h 1   Unknown (04h)
  186h 6   Zerofilled
  18Ch 1   Unknown (01h)
  18Dh 1   Zero
  18Eh 1   Media Unit Size (200h SHL N) (usually 00h, aka 200h-bytes)
  18Fh 2Fh Zerofilled (unencrypted, despite of below)
  1BEh 42h Encrypted MBR partition-table, for the two DSi partitions
             (key-data used for this keyslot is console-unique).
 For ROM carts:
  160h 20h Exheader SHA-256 hash (uh, really?)                     (usually 0)
  180h 4   Additional header size (uh, does that mean "Exheader"?) (usually 0)
  184h 4   Sector zero offset (whatever, in whatever units, usually 0)
  188h ..  Partition Flags (uh, why called "flags" and why "partition"?)
  188h 1   Backup Write Wait Time (The time to wait to write save to backup
             after the card is recognized (0-255 seconds)). NATIVE_FIRM loads
             this flag from the gamecard NCSD header starting with 6.0.0-11.
  189h 1   unknown, maybe related to below "Save Crypto"?
  18Ah 1   unknown, ?
  18Bh 1   Media Card Device (1=NOR Flash, 2=None, 3=BT) (SDK 3.X+)
  18Ch 1   Media Platform Index (1=CTR)
  18Dh 1   Media Type Index (0=InnerDevice, 1=Card1, 2=Card2, 3=ExtendedDevice)
  18Eh 1   Media Unit Size (200h SHL N)
  18Fh 1   Media Card Device (1=NOR Flash, 2=None, 3=BT) (Only SDK 2.X)
  190h 40h Partition ID table (8x8 bytes)
  1D0h 20h Reserved
  1F0h 0Eh Reserved?
  1FEh 1   Support for this was implemented with 9.6.0-X FIRM.
             Bit0=1 enables using bits 1-2, it's unknown what these two
             bits are actually used for (the value of these two bits get
             compared with some other value during NCSD
             verification/loading).
             This appears to enable a new, likely hardware-based,
             antipiracy check on cartridges.
  1FFh 1   Support for this was implemented with 9.6.0-X FIRM, see below
             regarding save crypto.
```



## NCSD Signature


The RSA pubk used for gamecard NCSD is stored in ITCM (what/wherefrom?).

The RSA pubk used for NAND NCSD is stored in "Process9 .(ro)data instead of
ITCM". Uh, shouldn't that key (also?) be in bootrom?



## Partition Flags (In Terms of Save Crypto Determination) (uh, Save what?)


Note: Byte 01h,03h,07h do probably refer to NCSD[189h,18Bh,18Fh].

Note: flag[1,3,7] do probably ALSO refer to NCSD[189h,18Bh,18Fh].

Note: partitionflag[1,3,7] do MAYBE ALSO refer to NCSD[189h,18Bh,18Fh]?

```
  Byte   Description
  01h    Starting with 6.0.0-11 NATIVE_FIRM will use this flag to determine
           the gamecard savegame keyY method, when flag[3] is set.
           00h = 2.0.0-2 hashed keyY,
           01h = new keyY method implemented with 6.0.0-11.
           0Ah = implemented with 9.3.0-X. On Old3DS this is identical to
             the 2.2.0-4 crypto. On New3DS this is identical to the 2.2.0-4
             crypto, except with New3DS-only gamecard savedata keyslots.
```

Starting with 9.6.0-X FIRM, Process9 now sets \<savecrypto\_stateval> to
partitionflag[1] + \<the u8 value from NCSD+0x1FF>, instead of just
setting it to partitionflag[1].

```
  03h    Support for this flag was implemented in NATIVE_FIRM with 2.0.0-2.
           When this flag is set the hashed gamecard savegame keyY method is
           used, this likely still uses the repeating-CTR however.
           With 6.0.0-11 the system will determine the gamecard savegame keyY
           method via flag[1], instead of just using the hashed keyY via this
           flag.
  07h    This flag enables using the hashed gamecard savegame keyY method,
           support for this flag was implemented in NATIVE_FIRM with 2.2.0-4.
           All games with the NCSD image finalized since 2.2.0-4 (and contains
           2.2.0-4+ in the system update partition) have this flag set, this
           flag also enables using new CTR method as well.
```

Starting with 9.6.0-X FIRM, Process9 will just write val0 to a state field then
return 0, instead of returning an error when the save crypto type isn't
recognized. This was the \*only\* actual functionality change in the Old3DS
Process9 function for gamecard savedata crypto init.



## Card Info Header - uh, maybe this is the "Exheader" aka "Additional header"?


```
  Offset Size  Description
  200h   4     CARD2: Writable Address In Media Units (For 'On-Chip' Savedata)
               CARD1: Always FFFFFFFFh.
  204h   4     Card Info Bitmask
  208h   108h? Reserved1
  300h   4     Unknown (1DD7AA00h)
  ...    ..
  310h   2     Title version
  312h   2     Card revision
  ...    ..
  320h   8     Title ID for CVer USA (000400db00017202h) (even so in JPN cart)
  328h   ?     Unknown (1022h)
  208h?? CEEh? Reserved2
  1000h  10h   Card seed AES-KeyY (first u64 is Media ID (same as first NCCH
                 partitionId))
  1010h  10h   Encrypted card seed (AES-CCM, keyslot 3Bh for retail cards,
                 see CTRCARD_SECSEED)
  1020h  10h   Card seed AES-MAC
  1030h  0Ch   Card seed AES-IV
  103Ch  C4h   Reserved3
  1100h  100h  Copy of first NCCH header (excluding RSA signature)
 Development Card Info Header Extension:
 Unknown how to read from 1200h..3FFFh. When trying to do so on retail card:
 Encrypted read (cmd BFh) does merely return random garbage at 1200h..3FFFh.
 Unencrypted read (cmd 82h) can read from 1000h only (though MAYBE it can
 read MULTIPLE blocks from 1000h upwards?)
 Below says something about NTR cmd 90h or CTR cmd 90h or A2h, but that
 refers to getting the 32bit Chip ID, not to header data at 1200h and up.
  1200h  200h  CardDeviceReserved1
  1400h  10h   TitleKey (whever that is... something alike as in tickets?)
  1410h  F0h   CardDeviceReserved2
```

Note that a particular(=which?) flashcard vendor puts what many(=who?) refer to
as "private headers"(=what?) here in place of actual development card
information. This(=which?) header is constituted(=whut?) by a cartridge-unique
Id obtained from pxi:ps9::GetRomId(=what?) and the title-unique cart ID
(identical for all carts of the same title; can be retrieved using the NTR
gamecard protocol command 90h or through the CTR protocol commands 90h or A2h)
(uh, actually, that is the Chip ID, not a "title-unique cart ID" thing).



## Tools


ctrtool - (CMD) (Windows/Linux) Parsing NCSD files

3DSExplorer - (GUI) (Windows Only) Parsing NCSD files




# <a name="3dsfilesfirmformat"></a>3DS Files - FIRM Format



File format for the 3DS' Firmware, it contains up to four 'sections' of data
comprising the ARM9 and ARM11 kernels, and some fundamental processes.

The firmware sections are not encrypted.


The ARM9 section contains the ARM9 kernel (and loader) and the Process9 NCCH
(which is the only process run in user mode on the ARM9). The ARM11 sections
contain the ARM11 kernel (and loader), and various ARM11 process NCCHs. For
NATIVE\_FIRM/SAFE\_MODE\_FIRM these ARM11 processes are sm, fs, pm, loader, and
pxi. Normally the 4th section is not used. The code loaded from FIRM is
constantly running on the system until another FIRM is launched. The ARM11
kernel is hard-coded to always decompress the ExeFS .code of embedded ARM11
NCCHs without checking the exheader compression bit.


FIRM Format can exist in two locations:

```
  As raw eMMC sectors (defined in the NCSD Header of the eMMC storage)
  As .firm files (in NCCH .app files, in the "\title\00040138" firmware folder)
```

And, in Wifi-Flash and NTRCARDs (that's both only for repair/unbricking).



## FIRM Header


```
  000h  4       ID "FIRM"
  004h  4       Boot priority (0=Normal/Lowest)
  008h  4       ARM11 Entrypoint (usually 1FFxxxxxh, aka AXI WRAM.. or DSP?)
  00Ch  4       ARM9 Entrypoint  (usually 080xxxxxh, aka ARM9-only RAM)
  010h  30h     Reserved (0)
  040h  30h     Firmware Section Header 1 (usually several NCCH's with ExeFS)
  070h  30h     Firmware Section Header 2 (usually ARM11 code)
  0A0h  30h     Firmware Section Header 3 (usually ARM9 code & Process9 NCCH)
  0D0h  30h     Firmware Section Header 4 (often unused, zerofilled)
  100h  100h    RSA-2048 SHA-256 signature of the FIRM header
```

The RSA signature is checked when bootrom/Process9 are doing FIRM-launch (with
the public key being hardcoded in each). The signature is not checked when
installing FIRM to the NAND firm0/firm1 partitions.



## Firmware Section Headers


```
  000h  4       Byte offset      (relative to begin of FIRM header)
  004h  4       Physical address where the section is loaded to
  008h  4       Byte-size    (or 0=None)
  00Ch  4       Copy-method (0=NDMA, 1=XDMA, 2=CPU mem-copy)
                            (0=ARM9/WRAM, 1=ARM11/AXI/VRAM, 2=?)
  010h  20h     SHA-256 Hash of Firmware Section
```

Note on Copy-method: Process9 ignores this field. Boot9 doesn't immediately
throw an error when this isn't 0..2. In that case it will jump over
section-data-loading which then results in the hash verification with the below
hash being done with the hash already stored in the SHA hardware.



## FIRM Load Areas


Common Load areas are:

```
  08006000h 0.9M  ARM9-WRAM  (common for ARM9 code) (not first/last some bytes)
  18000000h 6.0M  VRAM       (eg. used by GBA/DSi firmwares)
  1FF00000h 0.5M  DSP Memory (eg. used by FIRM0)
  1FF80000h 0.5M  AXI RAM    (common for ARM11 code)
```

With that areas, a FIRM file can be max 7.9Mbyte (if it is loaded as file, the
default size of the firm0/firm1 partitions is only 4Mbyte each).

There is a blacklist in bootrom preventing some memory regions:

```
  07FFB800h..07FFFBFFh  ARM9 ITCM part (otp, mbr, keys...)
  FFF00000h..FFF02FFFh  ARM9 DTCM (first 3000h) (arm9 data)
  FFF03000h..FFF03FFFh  ARM9 DTCM (last 1000h) (arm9 stack)
  080F8000h..080FFFFFh  ARM9 WRAM (last 8000h) (rom card related?)
  08000000h..0800003Fh  ARM9 WRAM (first 40h) (exception vectors, etc)
  20000000h..27FFFFFFh  FCRAM (whole 128MB)
  FFF00000h..1FFFFFFFh  Bugged (size of that area is negative/nonsense)
```

Moreover, the bootrom doesn't have Main RAM and New3DS memory enabled. And, the
bootrom PU has also disabled some memory areas (though those might pass when
using DMA for loading?).




# <a name="3dsfilesfirmencryption"></a>3DS Files - FIRM Encryption



FIRMs are more or less unencrypted, except that they are stored in encrypted
memory:

- - FIRM bootcode is stored in an encrypted partition (with the usual eMMC
    - encryption; using a different keyslot than FAT partitions though)
- - FIRMs for GBA/DSi/SafeMode are stored in NCCHs files (with the eMMC
    - filesystem encryption; and usually with NCCH[18Fh].bit2=1, ie. no further
    - encryption in NCCH ExeFS)

Apart from that, FIRMs are having a RSA signature (which can be broken via
sighax).



## Self-decrypting New3DS FIRMs


New3DS FIRMs are containing self-decrypting ARM9 code (there is no requirement
to do that in homebrew FIRMs, it's basically a nag feature, making it slightly
more difficult to disassemble or patch the official FIRMs).

The ARM9 block (the FIRM section with the ARM9 entrypoint) looks as so:

```
  000h 10h  Encrypted Key_15h_x (same for all FIRM's)
  010h 10h  AES-CTR Key Y   ;\for decrypting the code at 800h and up
  020h 10h  AES-CTR IV      ;/(these are different in each FIRM version)
  030h 8    Size of encrypted binary as decimal ASCII string (eg. "546048",0,0)
  038h 8    Padding (FFh-filled)
  040h 10h  Encrypted zeroes (won't boot if decrypted data is nonzero)
  050h 7B0h Padding (FFh-filled)                        ;-before version 9.5.0
  050h 10h  Some kind of unused debug info              ;\
  060h 10h  Encrypted Key_16h_x                         ; version 9.5.0 and up
  070h 790h Padding (00h-filled)                        ;/
  800h ..   Encrypted ARM9-binary (size as from [030h], eg. 546048 bytes)
  ...  ..   Code: Unencrypted ARM9 bootstub
  ...  10h  Data: Seed value for key 18h..1Fh       (eg. A4h,8Dh,E4h,F1h,..)
  ...  10h  Data: Key_15h_y (for encrypted zeroes)  (eg. 25h,91h,2Ah,C1h,..)
  ...  4    Data: Entrypoint to decrypted ARM9 code (eg. 08xxxxxxh)
  ...  1+3  Data: Some flag byte (initially zero, and FFh-filled padding)
  ...  ..   Padding to 200h-byte boundary (zerofilled)
  NOTE: Later FIRMs do reportedly have another Seed value for key 19h-1Fh,
  which is probably inserted somewhere(?) in the above data area.
```

Alongsides with the keys stored at begin & end of the above ARM9 block, the
decryption code use two more sources:

```
  SHA256 computed across first 90h bytes of encrypted OTP memory
  Data read from eMMC address 12C00h (aka eMMC sector number 96h)
```

Aside from doing the self-decryption, the bootstub does additionally initialize
keyslots 15h, 16h, and 18h..1Fh (some of those are being used elsewhere).

```

As shown above, there are three revisions (v8.1 being the original New3DS
firmware, and small changes made in v9.5 and v9.6). The versions before v9.5
didn't actually touch keyslot 16h (the key\_16h\_x/y values shown above were
written to keyslot 15h). The versions before v9.6 did produce other keys for
keyslot 19h-1Fh (but they were never used, so one will only need the newer v9.6
values; which require finding a yet unknown seed value though).



## Terror


Caution: The FIRM key init description on 3dbrew FIRM page is incomplete,
confusing, irrelevant, and simply mind blowing (the description won't make any
sense at all without simultaneously looking at the disassembled firmware code;
or perhaps looking at above pseudo code).

## New3DS ARM9 kernel - weird blurb


The only actual code-difference for the Old3DS/New3DS ARM9-kernels' crt0,
besides TWL AES / 10012000h (=OTP?) related code, is that the New3DS
ARM9-kernel writes 1 to REG\_EXTMEMCNT9 (=CFG9\_EXTMEMCNT9?) in the crt0 (unknown
what crt0 means, elsewhere it's said that "0xffff8000 is crt0", although that
does actually more look like a ROM address).



## New3DS Process9


The following is all of the differences for Old3DS/New3DS Process9 with
9.3.0-X:

The FIRM-launch code called at the end of the New3DS proc9 main() has different
mem-range checks.

In the New3DS proc9, the v6.0/v7.0 keyinit function at the very beginning
(before the original code) had additional code added for setting CTRNAND
keyslot 0x5, with keydata from .data. After setting the keyY, the keyY in .data
is cleared.

In New3DS proc9, the functions for getting the gamecard crypto keyslots / NCCH
keyslot can return New3DS keyslots when New3DS flags (NCSD/NCCH) are set.

The code/data for the binary near the end of arm9mem is slightly different,
because of memory-region sizes.

The only difference in .data (besides the above code binary) is that the New3DS
proc9 has an additional 0x10-byte block for the keyslot 0x5 keyY, see above.



## Variations


There exists different official firmwares for the 3DS: The default one
(NATIVE\_FIRM) is used to run all 3DS content and boots by default, while
backwards compatibility is handled by TWL\_FIRM and AGB\_FIRM. There furthermore
is a rescue mode provided by SAFE\_MODE\_FIRM.



## NATIVE\_FIRM


NATIVE\_FIRM is the FIRM which is installed to the NAND firm partitions, which
is loaded by bootrom.

Note: The above "builder" strings seem to be the actual Month/Day built-date.



## SAFE\_MODE\_FIRM


SAFE\_MODE is used for running the System Updater. SAFE\_MODE\_FIRM and
NATIVE\_FIRM for the initial versions are exactly the same, except for the
system core version fields.



## TWL\_FIRM


TWL\_FIRM handles DS(i) backwards compatibility.

The 3DS-mode ARM9 core seems to switch into DSi-mode (for running DSi-mode ARM9
code) by writing to a PDN register (this changes the memory layout to DSi-mode
/ etc, therefore this register poke \*must\* be executed from ITCM). This is the
final 3DS-mode register poke before the ARM9 switches into DSi-mode. DS(i)-mode
ARM7 code is run on the internal ARM7 core, which is started up during TWL\_FIRM
boot. Trying to read from the exception-vector region (address 0x0) under this
DSi-mode ARM7 seems to only return 0x00/0xFF data. Also note that this DSi-mode
ARM7 runs code (stored in TWL\_FIRM) which pokes some DSi-mode registers that on
the DSi were used for disabling access to the DSi bootROMs, however these
registers do not affect the 3DS DSi-mode ARM9/ARM7 "bootrom" region
(exceptionvector region + 0x8000) at all.


For shutting down the system, TWL\_FIRM writes MCU[20h]=08h. For returning to
3DS-mode, TWL\_FIRM writes to MCU[20h]=04h to trigger a hardware system reboot.


The TWL\_FIRM ARM11-process includes a TWL bootloader, see here(?) and here(?)
for details.


TWL\_FIRM verifies all TWL RSA padding with the following. This is different
from the DSi "BIOS" code.

The first byte must be 0x0.

The second byte must be 0x1 or 0x2.

Executes a while(\<value of byte at current pos in RSA message>). When the
second\_byte in the message is 0x1, the byte at curpos must be 0xFF (otherwise
the non-zero value of the byte at curpos doesn't matter). This loop must find a
zero byte before offset 0x7F in the message otherwise an error is returned.

Returns an address for msg\_curpos+1.


totalhashdatasize = rsasig\_bytesize - above position in the message for the
hashdata. The actual "totalhashdatasize" in the RSA message must be \<=
\<expected hashdata\_size>(0x74 for bootloader). Uh, \<=\<>()??? The
TWL\_FIRM code copies the RSA "hashdata" to the output buffer, using the actual
size of the RSA "hashdata".



## AGB\_FIRM


AGB\_FIRM handles running GBA VC titles. The ARM9 FIRM section for TWL\_FIRM and
AGB\_FIRM are exactly the same (for TWL\_FIRM and AGB\_FIRM versions which were
updated with the same system-update).




# <a name="3dsfilesfirmlaunchparameters"></a>3DS Files - FIRM Launch Parameters




## FIRM Launch Parameters


The FIRM-launch parameters structure is located at FCRAM+0, size 0x1000-bytes.
The ARM11-kernel copies this structure elsewhere, then clears the 0x1000-bytes
at FCRAM+0. It will not handle an existing structure at FCRAM+0 if CFG\_BOOTENV
is zero. The ARM9 kernel writes some values about the boot environment to AXI
WRAM during init to enable this.

Note: it seems NATIVE\_FIRM ARM11-kernel didn't parse this during boot until
3.0.0-X?

              to 0x1FF80060): "FIRM_?", FIRM_VERSIONREVISION,

              the kernel
  43Ch 4    CRC32 across [400h..53Fh] with [43Ch]=zero
              When invalid the kernel clears the entire buffer used for

  +00h    1       This can be used for overriding the default FCRAM
                    memory-regions allocation sizes (APPLICATION, SYSTEM, and
                    BASE). The values for this is the same as
                    Configmem-APPMEMTYPE. Values 0-1 are handled the same way
                    by the kernel. However for NS, 0=titleinfo structure for
                    launching a title isn't set, while non-zero=titleinfo
                    structure is set.
  +01h    3       Setting bit0 here enables overriding the FIRM_* fields in
                    Configuration_Memory.

  288h 2    CRC16 over the above fields from offset 0x0, size 0x288,
              if not valid, LGY FIRM uses dummy data from .(ro)data
  28Ah 2    If non-zero, the size (below) is hardcoded (currently) to
              value 0x288, otherwise the size field below is used
  28Ch 4    Value 0x288 (size used for verifying the CRC16)
```

"Cleared to zero" fields above are not read at all by LGY FIRM.




# <a name="3dsfilesncchformat"></a>3DS Files - NCCH Format




## NCCH (Nintendo Content Container Header) (in .app files)


This format is used to store the content of any installed title. There are two
NCCH variants:

```
  CXI aka CTR Executable Image, with ARM11 code
  CFA aka CTR File Archive, with data only
```

The CXI/CFA format is structured in the following order:

```
  NCCH header                                                  (unencrypted)
  Exheader (CXI only)                                          (encrypted)

  ExeFS filesystem (optional) - ARM11 code (CXI), icon/banner  (encrypted)
  RomFS filesystem (optional) - Used for external file storage (encrypted)
```

User-executable Tools (eg. System Settings) do have two NCCH .app files: One
with the program .code, and one with the data manual. Internal System Modules
(eg. MCU driver) have only one .app file (with program .code, without manual).

This region contains several zero-terminated ASCII strings (usually in form
"[SDK+Blah:Blahblah]",00h).

```
  "The version used for the "FIRMWARE" tag (what?) is the kernel/FIRM
  version, this version can also be stored in the exheader "kernel release
  version" ARM11 kernel descriptor field. As of 2.2.0-X the NATIVE_FIRM
  kernels check the CXI exheader "kernel release version" field, if it is
  stored in the CXI exheader. If the kernel/FIRM version specified by this
  field is higher than the version of the running NATIVE_FIRM, the kernel
  will return error-code D9001413h."
```

Uh, all that blurb seems to say that... the SDK string is irrelevant - and if
there's anything relevant, then it's the descriptor, but not/never the SDK
string?



## ExeFS and RomFS (Filesystems)


- [3DS Files - NCCH ExeFS](#3dsfilesncchexefs)
- [3DS Files - NCCH RomFS](#3dsfilesncchromfs)
Both ExeFS and RomFS are designed as read-only filesystems (in lack of a FAT,
changing filesizes would require to relocate all following files).



## Encryption (for Exheader, ExeFS, and RomFS)


- [3DS Files - NCCH Encryption](#3dsfilesncchencryption)


## Region Locking


The region-locking info checked by home menu is stored in the "icon" file in
ExeFS.



## RSA


CFAs NCCH header signature uses a fixed RSA public key.

CXIs NCCH header signature uses the RSA public key stored in the Exheader
(whereof, that part of the Exheader is signed via another RSA key).



## Tools


ctrtool - (CMD) (Windows/Linux) Parsing and decrypting (debug only) NCCH files




# <a name="3dsfilesncchextendedheader"></a>3DS Files - NCCH Extended Header



The NCCH Exheader contains information for the .code file in the ExeFS (the
.code file itself has no file header, and contains only raw code/data).


The Exheader exists only if NCCH[180h]>0. That is, it does exist for NCCH's
with ExeFS .code file. For some reason ExeFS .firm does also have Exheader (but
unknown if it's used for anything). Whilst E-Manuals have only RomFS, without
ExeFS, and without Exheader.



## NCCH Extended Header (Exheader, at offset 200h and up)


```
  200h 200h  SCI, System Control Info
  400h 200h  ACI, Access Control Info 1
  600h 100h  RSA-SHA256 Signature across [900h..BFFh] (using key from bootrom)
  700h 100h  RSA Public Key for NCCH Header at [000h..1FFh]
  800h 200h  ACI, Access Control Info 2 (for limitation of first ACI)
```


When loading the exheader, Process9 compares the exheader data with the data in
the AccessDesc (note that not everything is compared here). When these don't
match, an error is returned. The Process9 code handling this validation was
updated with v6.0; the only change in this function seems to be the check for
the "Ideal processor" field.

## Flag0


```
  Bits  Description
  0-1   Ideal processor
  2-3   Affinity mask
  4-7   Old3DS system mode:
          0    =  Prod (64MB of usable application memory)
          1    =  Undefined (unusable)
          2    =  Dev1 (96MB of usable application memory)
          3    =  Dev2 (80MB of usable application memory)
          4    =  Dev3 (72MB of usable application memory)
          5    =  Dev4 (32MB of usable application memory)
          6-7  =  Undefined Same as Prod?
          8-15 =  unknown/unspecified
```

In the exheader data, the ideal processor field is a bit-index, while in the
AccessDesc (the 2nd ACI at A00h and up) the ideal processor field is a bitmask.
When the bit specified by the exheader field is not set in the AccessDesc
field, an error is returned.

if((1 \<\< exheaderval) & accessdescval == 0) return error


During a FIRM-launch when a TitleInfo structure was specified, the field at
offset 400h in the FIRM-launch parameters is set to the SystemMode of the
specified title, however in some cases other values are written there. With
8.0.0-18 NS will now check the output of PTMSYSM command 040A0000h, when the
output is non-zero and a certain NS state field is value-zero, the following is
executed otherwise this is skipped. With that check passed on 8.0.0-18, NS will
then check (Flag2 & 0Fh). When that is value2, the output value (used for
the FIRM-launcher parameter field mentioned above) is set to value7. Otherwise,
when that value is non-zero, the output value is set to 6.



## Flag1


```
  Bits  Description
  0     EnableL2Cache (Unknown what this actually does, New3DS-only presumably)
  1     cpuspeed_804MHz (Default "cpuspeed" when not set)
  2-7   Unused
```


In order for the exheader to have any of the above new bits set, the AccessDesc
must have the corresponding bit set, otherwise the invalid-exheader error is
returned.


Homebrew which runs under a title which has the above cpuspeed flag set, runs
much faster on New3DS. It's unknown how exactly the system handles these flags.


When launching titles / perhaps other things with APT, NS uses
PTMSYSM:ConfigureNew3DSCPU with data which originally came from these flags; NS
does this regardless of what the running 3DS system is. However, due to a
bug(?) in NS the value sent to that command is always either 00h or 03h. When
calculating that value, the code only ever uses the cpuspeed field, not the
cache field: code to actually load and check the value of the cache field
appears to be missing.



## Flag2


```
  Bit     Description
  0-3     New3DS system mode:
            0    = Legacy (use Old3DS system mode)
            1    = Prod (124MB of usable application memory)
            2    = Dev1 (178MB of usable application memory)
            3    = Dev2 (124MB of usable application memory)
            4-7  = Undefined Same as Prod?
            8-15 = unknown/unspecified
  4-7     Unused
```

When in Legacy mode, the actual memory layout is the same as in New3DS Prod,
except the available application memory as reported to the application is
reduced to the Old3DS size.


The exheader value for the New3DS system mode value must be equal to the
AccessDesc value, otherwise the invalid-exheader error is returned.



## Storage Info Filesystem Access Info

```

When bit57 is set, the "Extdata ID" and "Storage Accessable Unique IDs" regions
are used to store a total of 6 "Accessible Save IDs". Introduced in 6.0.0.



## Service Access Control


This is the list of services which the process is allowed to access, this is
registered with the services manager. Each service listed in the exheader must
be listed in the AccessDesc, otherwise the invalid exheader error is returned.
The order of the services for exheader/AccessDesc doesn't matter. The
AccessDesc can list services which are not in the exheader, but normally the
service-access-control data for exheader/AccessDesc are exactly the same.

This list is submitted to SRVPM:RegisterProcess.



## ARM11 Kernel Capability Descriptors


The kernel capability descriptors are passed to svcCreateProcess.

There are different descriptor types, determined by the number of leading ones
in the binary value representation of bits 20-31. The different types are laid
out as follows:

```
  Bit31-20      Expl.
  1110xxxxxxxx  Interrupt info
  11110xxxxxxx  System call mask
                  Bits 24-26: System call mask table index
                  Bits 0-23: mask
  1111110xxxxx  Kernel release version
                  Bits 8-15: Major version
                  Bits 0-7: Minor version
  11111110xxxx  Handle table size
                  Bits 0-18: size
  111111110xxx  Kernel flags
                  Bit  Description
                  0    Allow debug
                  1    Force debug
                  2    Allow non-alphanum
                  3    Shared page writing
                  4    Privilege priority
                  5    Allow main() args
                  6    Shared device memory
                  7    Runnable on sleep
                  8-11 Memory type (1: application, 2: system, 3: base)
                  12   Special memory
                  13   Process has access to CPU core 2 (New3DS only)
  11111111100x  Map address range
                  Describes a memory mapping like the 111111111110
                  descriptor, but an entire range rather than a single
                  page is mapped. Another 11111111100x descriptor
                  must follow this one to denote the (exclusive) end
                  of the address range to map
  111111111110  Map memory page
                  Bits 0-19: page index to map (virtual address >> 12;
                  the physical address is determined per-page according
                  to Memory layout); Bit 20: Map read-only (otherwise
                  read-write)
```



## ARM9 Access Control Descriptors


```
  Bit     Description
  0       Mount nand:/
  1       Mount nand:/ro/ (Write Access)
  2       Mount twln:/

# <a name="3dsfilesncchexefs"></a>3DS Files - NCCH ExeFS




## ExeFS Header (max 10 files)


```
  000h 10h*10  File headers for File 1..10        ;First at 000h
  0A0h 20h     Reserved
  0C0h 20h*10  SHA256 Hash for File 10..1         ;First at 1E0h
```

File hashes are stored in reverse order, i.e. the hash at offset 1E0h
corresponds to the first ExeFS section.

Each file header has a corresponding file hash, which is the SHA256 hash
calculated over the entire file contents.



## File headers


There are a maximum of 10 file headers in the ExeFS format (the maximum number
of file headers is disputable, with makerom indicating a maximum of 8 sections
and makecia indicating a maximum of 10 (uh, are homebrew tools?). From a
non-SDK point of view, the ExeFS header format can hold no more than 10 file
headers within the currently define size of 200h bytes). The file headers have
the following structure:

```
  00h 8     File name (ASCII, zeropadded) (all 00h for unused entries)
  08h 4     File offset in bytes (0=Right after the 200h-byte ExeFS Header)
  0Ch 4     File size in bytes
```

File offsets are non-inclusive of the header's size (200h bytes). Also, file
headers which are not used are filled with all zeros.

The file offsets should be 200h-byte aligned. The file size is usually 4-byte
aligned (unknown if that is actually required).



## ExeFS Files


ExeFS or Executable Filesystem contains information related to the executable
program, and is the part of the CXI format.

The ExeFS usually contains one or more of the following files:

```
  .code   Contains ARM11 code, which can be optionally
            reverse-LZSS compressed via an exheader flag.
  .firm   Contains FIRM with ARM9/ARM11 code (usually plus some NCCH's)
  logo    Contains distribution licensing Binary data
  banner  Contains the banner which homemenu uses for this CXI
  icon    Contains the icon which homemenu displays for this CXI
```

- [3DS Files - NCCH Logo](#3dsfilesncchlogo)


## .code (ARM11)


The .code file does simply contain plain code/data without any file header
(instead, the .code file's load addresses and compression flag are located in
the NCCH Exheader).

For the LZrev decompression function, see:

- [LZ Decompression Functions](#lzdecompressionfunctions)
The (decompressed) filesize should be a multiple of 1000h bytes (and the
code/const/data sections should be on 1000h-byte page boundaries, as specified
in the NCCH Exheader).



## .code (GBA)


The .code files for GBA games do reportedly contain the GBA ROM-image, with an
extra GBA Footer (with info on cartridge type and preferred LCD color scheme).
For details:

- [3DS Config - ARM7 Registers (GBA/NDS/DSi Mode)](#3dsconfigarm7registersgbandsdsimode)
Unknown if GBA games have specific entries in NCCH header/exheader.

```

The "Logical Offsets" are completely unrelated to the physical offsets in the
RomFS partition. Instead, the "Logical Offsets" might be something about where
to map the Level 1-3 sections in virtual memory (with the physical Level 3,1,2
ordering being re-ordered to Level 1,2,3)?

The various SHA256's are similar to the "Digest" tables in DSi cart header.



## RomFS Directory/File area (aka Level 3) (usually/always? starting at 1000h)


```
  000h 4    Header Length (usually 28h)
  004h 4    Directory Hash Table Offset (usually 28h)
  008h 4    Directory Hash Table Length
  00Ch 4    Directory Table Offset (eg. 44h) (first=Root)
  010h 4    Directory Table Length
  014h 4    File Hash Table Offset
  018h 4    File Hash Table Length
  01Ch 4    File Table Offset (eg. 170h) (starting with Root)

  ..   ..   Directory Table
  ..   ..   File Hash Table
  ..   ..   File Table
  ..   ..   File Data (each file aligned to 10h-byte boundary)
```

Note: The first Directory Table entry is the Root directory. Apart from that,
there is no real requirement for the location of the other directory (and file)
table entries. However, Table entries are commonly held to be sorted
alphabetically. And, Siblings should be stored at continous table offsets (so
all entries for one directory are grouped together; that can speed up sector
loading).



## Directory Table Entries


```
  00h   4   Directory Table Offset of Parent Directory       (Self for Root)
  04h   4   Directory Table Offset of next Sibling Directory (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  08h   4   Directory Table Offset of first Child Directory  (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  0Ch   4   File Table Offset of first File                  (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  10h   4   Directory Table Offset of next Directory with same Hash
  14h   4   Name Length in bytes (ie. L=NumChars*2) (0 for Root)
  18h   L   Directory Name (16bit Unicode)
  18h+L 0/2 Alignment padding
```



## File Table Entries


```
  00h   4   Directory Table Offset of Parent Directory
  04h   4   File Table Offset of next Sibling File           (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  08h   8   File Data Offset (64bit)
  10h   8   File Data Size   (64bit)
  18h   4   File Table Offset of next File with same Hash    (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  1Ch   4   Name Length in bytes (ie. L=NumChars*2)
  20h   L   File Name (16bit Unicode)
  20h+L 0/2 Alignment padding
```



## File/Directory Hash Tables (for quick lookup)


```
  00h   N*4 Offset to File/Directory with matching Chksum (FFFFFFFFh=None)
```

These tables can be used for fast lookup (faster than doing char-by-char string
compares for all names in directory). For searching a specific name in a
specific directory, compute a checksum on the Directory Offset and Name:

```
  chksum = ParentDirectoryOffset XOR 123456789
  for i=0 to NameLength/2-1
    chksum = (chksum ROR 5) XOR Name[i*2]  ;32bit rotate, then XOR lower 16bit
  offset = hashtable [(chksum MOD (hashtablesize/4))*4]
```

Then verify if Name(offset) and ParentDirectory entry(offset) do actually
match, and else retry with offset=NextHashOffset(offset).

Note: The hashtablesize's should be roughly same or bigger than the total
number of files/directories in the RomFS (multiplied by 4, as each entry is
32bit wide). Even then, there can be false matches, including matches in
different directories (which can slowdown things when needing additional sector
reads for obtaining the table entries for such directories).



## RomFS can be used for...


```
  in conjunction with the ExeFS of a NCCH
  to contain the game manual accessible from the Home Menu
  to contain the DLP Child CIA   ;uh, is that "CIA" a homebrew fileformat?
  to contain game cartridge update data
```




# <a name="3dsfilesncchencryption"></a>3DS Files - NCCH Encryption



The extended header, the ExeFS, and the RomFS are encrypted using AES-CTR.



## AES-CTR Encryption FirstKeyX and FirstKeyY:


The FirstKey is used for NCCH Exheader, and ExeFS Header, and for two ExeFS
files ("icon" and "banner").

```
  FirstKeyX = KeyX from keyslot 2Ch (as set by bootrom)
  FirstKeyY = NCCH[000h..00Fh]  ;first 10h bytes of RSA signature
```



## AES-CTR Encryption SecondKeyX and SecondKeyY:


The SecondKey is also used for the whole RomFS (header, all files, and
SHA256's). And, for all ExeFS files (EXCEPT "icon" and "banner"), ie. it's used
for ".code", ".firm", "logo", and any further ExeFS files.

```
  if NCCH[18Bh]=00h then SecondKeyX = KeyX from keyslot 2Ch (original firmware)
  if NCCH[18Bh]=01h then SecondKeyX = KeyX from keyslot 25h (firm7.0.0)
  if NCCH[18Bh]=0Ah then SecondKeyX = KeyX from keyslot 18h (firm9.3.0) ;\New
  if NCCH[18Bh]=0Bh then SecondKeyX = KeyX from keyslot 1Bh (firm9.6.0) ;/3DS
  if NCCH[18Fh].bit5=0 then SecondKeyY = NCCH[000h..00Fh]   (original firmware)
  if NCCH[18Fh].bit5=0 then SecondKeyY = see SEEDDB below   (firm9.6.0)
```

With the original firmware, the SecondKey is just same as FirstKey (ie. there's
only one key in that case). Newer firmwares have added the extra keys shown
above, but they aren't used for ALL titles (eg. a new 3DS may use keyslot 25h
for eShop, and keyslot 2Ch for System Settings).



## SecondKeyY from SEEDDB (firm9.6.0) (New3DS)


```
  ;load SEEDDB (nand:/data/<ID0>/sysdata/0001000f/00000000),
  ;that file contains 32byte entries (with 8-byte Title ID, 16-byte seed,
  ;plus 8-byte reserved; whereof titleid might refer to ProgramID or so?),
  ;find the matching entry for current "titleid", then do:
  temp[00h..0Fh] = seed for current title (from SEEDDB file)           ;\
  temp[10h..17h] = NCCH[118h..11Fh]  ;Program ID                       ; test
  sha256(dst=temp, src=temp, srclen=18h)                               ;
  if temp[00h..03h] <> NCCH[114h..117h] then error                     ;/
  temp[00h..0Fh] = NCCH[000h..00Fh]  ;first 10h bytes of RSA signature ;\
  temp[10h..1Fh] = seed for current title (from SEEDDB file)           ; key
  sha256(dst=temp, src=temp, srclen=20h)                               ;
  SecondKeyY=temp[00h..0Fh]  ;use first 10h bytes of SHA256 as KeyY    ;/
```



## Special Cases


```
  if NCCH[18Fh].bit2=1                     ;\NoCrypto flag (eg. in NCCH's
    Exit  ;not encrypted                   ;/located inside of FIRM files)
  if NCCH[118h..11Fh]=NCCH[400h..407h]     ;\
    SkipDecrypt (or NeedEncrypt)           ; Program ID in Header vs Exheader
    ;above can be checked only if Exheader ; currently/already decrypted
    ;does exist, ie. if NCCH[180h]<>0      ;/
  if NCCH[18Fh].bit0=1  ;FixedCryptoKey flag         ;\
    if (ProgramID.MSW AND FFFFC010h)=00040010h       ; debug only, not retail:
      NormalKey=FixedSystemKey (52h,7Ch,E6h,30h,..)  ; instead of First/Second
    else                                             ; KeyX+KeyY
      NormalKey=Zerofilled (00h's)                   ;/
```



## Encryption IV


```
  if NCCH[112h]=01h  ;NCCH version (weird, is/was that version really used?)
    Force MediaUnitSize=1 (or 200h?) ;fixed? (instead of 200h SHL N bytes?)
    IV[00h..07h] = NCCH[108h..10Fh]    ;NCCH Partition ID (forwards!)
    IV[08h..0Bh] = Zero
    IV[0Ch..0Fh] = BigEndianAddr (200h=Exheader, [1A0h]=ExeFS, [1B0h]=RomFS)
  if NCCH[112h]=02h  (or =00h, too?)   ;NCCH version
    IV[00h..07h] = NCCH[10Fh..108h]    ;NCCH Partition ID (backwards!)
    IV[08h]      = Type (01h=Exheader, 2=ExeFS, 3=RomFS)
    IV[09h..0Fh] = Zero (plus offset/10h within Exheader/ExeFS/RomFS area)
```

When starting elsewhere than BEGIN of Exheader/ExeFS/RomFS, add offset/10h to
the IV value (whereas, mind that IV is big-endian in the above description; it
may be easier to set the IV in little-endian mode though).




# <a name="3dsfilesncchlogo"></a>3DS Files - NCCH Logo



The logo was originally stored as file "logo" (in the encrypted ExeFS). Newer
files have the logo stored in separate unencrypted data block (see NCCH header
entries [130h,198h,19Ch]). Even in newer firmwares, the old location in "logo"
file is still used by Safe Mode files (at least so on Old3DS). Unknown if the
new logo block can also exist in absence of ExeFS.


"The Logo contains distribution licensing Binary data (types: Nintendo,
Licensed, Published, or Distributed). Additionally it could have no license
(type None). System applications and applets that interact with the Home Menu
are typically set to type 'none' as they don't display that information."



## Logo Compression


Reportedly "contains distribution licensing Binary data".

"The size of this logo is always 2000h-bytes."

The logo seems to be LZ11 compressed, see:

- [LZ Decompression Functions](#lzdecompressionfunctions)
This file is a LZ11 compressed DARC. The last 20h bytes of the decompressed
data is a HMAC SHA256 hash over the actual DARC.

The HMAC key(s) used for the SHA256-HMAC is unknown.



## Logo DARC Archive


- [3DS Files - Archive DARC](#3dsfilesarchivedarc)
The DARC contains three folders and several files (below is from Safe Mode
System Updater):

```

# <a name="3dsfilestitlecontentmetadatacmd"></a>3DS Files - Title Content Metadata (CMD)




## Content Metadata (.cmd) file format


```
  00h     4    File number for 000000nn.cmd file (eg. 3=00000003.cmd)
  04h     4    Number of Contents (N)
  08h     4    Number of Contents (N) (same as above)
  0Ch     4h   Zerofilled  ;reportedly always 1  ;\maybe shop titles??

  20h+N*8 -    Nothing     ;reportedly more AES-MAC's ???
```

The .cmd file is reportedly "encrypted with a console unique keyslot"???
(actually, it isn't encrypted at all, at least not on eMMC).


"\<ContentID>.cmd" - (The Content ID is a u32, initially: 00000001 when
the title is first installed. Changing by an increment of +0x1 for each time
the 3DS adds/removes '.app' files) This file contains data taken from the
title's TMD. See the below table for the format of the cleartext .cmd file. The
Title.db contains the Content ID for the '.cmd' file, but does not contain a
hash of the '.cmd' file. This acts as part of the DRM for installed titles,
along with the title.db.


The below AES-CMACs (including the last 0x10-bytes of the header) are only used
for SD titles, for NAND download-play titles, and non-system DSiWare titles.
For other titles, these MACs are set to all-zero.

```
  000h 4      .cmd ContentID, for the .cmd filename. This is the beginning
                of the header   ;uh, which header? what for?
  004h 4      Number of AES-CMACs and Content IDs in the first list (X).
                The method to determine this is explained below.
  008h 4      Number of Content IDs in the second list (Y)
  00Ch 4      Unknown, usually (always?) 1.
  010h 10h    AES-CMAC over first 0x10
  020h 4*X    List of installed Content IDs in order of Content Index, with
                missing contents replaced with 0xFFFFFFFF
  020h+4*X     4*Y     List of installed Content IDs in order of ID name
  020h+4*(X+Y) 10h*X   AES-CMACs for each content in the first list, generated
                         using the process below
```

The number of AES-CMACs depends on the highest Content Index installed. For
example, a title with 5 contents, but only 1 and 3 are installed, will still
result in 3 AES-CMACs, with the 2nd one being unused.


For SD contents, each AES-CMAC is generated by combining the NCCH header
without the signature (0x100-0x1FF), the Content Index and Content ID at the
end, both as u32. Then calculate the SHA256 of the data and generate the
AES-CMAC using the SD/NAND AES-CMAC key.


For TWLNAND contents, the same process is used (even for SRL contents) with the
keyslot for NAND dbs.





# <a name="3dsfilestitlemetadatatmd"></a>3DS Files - Title Metadata (TMD)



Title metadata is a format used to store information about a title (installed
title, DLC, etc.) and all its installed contents, including which contents they
consist of and their SHA256 hashes.

```

The CA certificate is issued by 'Root', the public key for which is stored in
NATIVE\_FIRM.




# <a name="3dsfilestitleticketticketdb"></a>3DS Files - Title Ticket (ticket.db)




## 3ds:\dbs\ticket.db (about 35.5Mbytes) (237F600h bytes)


ticket.db is a DIFF container containing a short 10h-byte header followed by a
BDRI filesystem.

- [3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF](#3dsfilessavedatadisaanddiff)
- [3DS Files - Savedata SAVE/BDRI/VSXE Formats](#3dsfilessavedatasavebdrivsxeformats)
The 10h-byte header (between DIFF and BDRI layer) looks as so:

```
  000h 8    ID "TICK",01h,00h,00h,00h
  008h 4    Garbage (eg. random, or 0)
  00Ch 4    Garbage (eg. random-30h, or 1)
  010h ...  BDRI filesystem (about 17Mbytes) (10A2000h) (with ticket files)
```

The BDRI can contain up to 8192 files, usually it does contain about 200
tickets for the system titles, including the DSiware titles, plus any further
tickets for titles purchased from e-Shop (no matter if the titles are stored on
eMCC or on SD Cards).


Tickets are a format used to store an encrypted titlekey (using AES-CBC). With
3DS, the Ticket format was updated (now v1) from Wii/DSi format (v0).

The Ticket Title Version is generally the same as the title version stored in
the Title Metadata. Although it doesn't have to match the TMD version to be
valid.



## TitleKey (for decrypting .app's in CIA's or Shop downloads)


First of, decrypt the ticket's Title Key via AES-CBC:

```
  dev/retail      = can be detected from RSA Signature Name at TIK[140h]
  KEY_X[00h..0Fh] = Keyslot 3Dh, as set by bootrom (differs for retail/dev)
  KEY_Y[00h..0Fh] = common key(0..5) from FIRM, index 0..5 from TIK[1F1h]
  KEY[00h..0Fh]   = derived from above KeyX/Y (retail key0..5 and dev key1..5)
  KEY[00h..0Fh]   = fixed normal key from FIRM (special, for dev key0 only)
  IV[00h..07h]    = Title ID (big-endian), from TIK[1DCh]
  IV[08h..0Fh]    = Zero
  SRC[00h..0Fh]   = Encrypted Title Key, from TIK[1BFh]
  aes-cbc decrypt
```

Then use the decrypted key to decrypt the .app via AES-CBC:

```
  KEY[00h..0Fh]   = Decrypted title key (decrypted from ticket)
  IV[00h..01h]    = Content Index (big endian, from TMD[B04h+N*30h+4])
  IV[02h..0Fh]    = Zero
  SIZE            = Content Size (from TMD[B04h+N*30h+8])
  aes-cbc decrypt (unless TMD[B04h+N*30h+6] has flagged encryption=0)
```

Note: For AES-CBC random access, one can use the preceeding "encrypted 10h-byte
block" as IV value (except, use the above IV for first block).

Unknown if there is a dev/retail flag in the ticket (if not, then one could

instead check the RSA Signature Name; retail="Root-CA00000003-XS0000000c")



## Limits


In demos, the first u32 in the "Limits" section is 0x4, then the second u32 is
the max-playcount.



## Certificate Chain


Tickets retrieved from CDN/SOAP have a certificate chain appended at the end of
the file. There are two certificates in this chain:

```
  CERTIFICATE SIG.TYPE  RETAIL CERT  DEBUG CERT  DESCRIPTION
  Ticket      RSA-2048  XS0000000c   XS00000009  to verify Ticket signature
  CA          RSA-4096  CA00000003   CA00000004  to verify Ticket Certificate
```

The CA certificate is issued by 'Root', the public key for which is stored in
NATIVE\_FIRM.



## Notes


CommonETicket (for short, cetk) is the name given to tickets for titles which
are not available on the eShop, like system titles. As the name suggests, they
are not unique tickets, the same ticket is common to each 3ds which has
installed that title. This is in contrast to tickets for eShop content, which
are generated prior to initial download, and are unique to 3ds it was generated
for.

CETK can be fetched through HTTP using the link to default update server, using
the title's TMD URL where "cetk" is used instead of "tmd" for the URL. The 3DS
NIM module retrieves system tickets via SOAP request GetSystemCommonETicket
instead of directly downloading the cetks with HTTPS. The cetks are also
accessible via HTTP (even though the 3DS never accesses them like that).



## Other Ticket files/folders


Apart from ticket.db, there is a 4B000h-byte file called 3ds:\tmp\title.tik
containing the following stuff:

```
  0000h 350h    Ticket (without 8-byte header)    ;-350h-byte ticket
  0350h 9Ch     Unknown (00h-filled)              ;\                    ;\

  ...   48*128h ...                               ;-128h-byte's as above;/
  3D20h 0B8h    Unknown (00h-filled)              ;\
  3DD8h 4       Unknown (52h,46h,00h,00h)         ; whatever
  3DDCh 4       Unknown (58h,A8h,07h,00h)         ;
  3DE0h 4       Unknown (B4h,32h,15h,00h)         ;/
  3DE4h 4721Ch  Unknown (00h-filled)              ;-lots of zeroes
```

Additionally, there are two empty ticket folders:

```
  3ds:\ticket\     ;on 3DS partition
  dsi:\ticket\     ;on DSi partition
```

The latter would have been used on DSi to store .tik files (but the 3DS does
instead store all tickets in ticket.db, including DSiware tickets).

The 200h-byte Public Key for the 'Root' signature is reportedly somewhere in
NATIVE\_FIRM (unknown where though, knowing the first some bytes would help)
(also unknown if it is the same 'Root' key as on DSi).

The DSi has a similar file called cert.sys:

- [DSi SD/MMC Firmware dev.kp and cert.sys Certificate Files](ds.html#dsisdmmcfirmwaredevkpandcertsyscertificatefiles)
The DIFF container uses the standard DISA/DIFF format

- [3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF](#3dsfilessavedatadisaanddiff)
However, the DIFF in certs.db does contain raw data (instead of the
SAVE/BDRI/VSXE filesystems that are usually found in DISA/DIFF containers).




# <a name="3dsfilestitledatabasefilestitledbimportdbetc"></a>3DS Files - Title Database Files (title.db, import.db, etc.)



These files contain data relating to install/usage/management of installed 3DS
titles. The database files are located at:

```
  3ds:\dbs\*.db
  sd:\Nintendo 3DS\<ID0>\<ID1>\dbs\*.db
```

ID0 is the first 0x10-bytes from a SHA256 hash. The installation of SD Card
titles was introduced in the 2.0.0-2 update and the SD dbs files are encrypted
by the general SD filesystem encryption rule. These files are DIFF containers.
These DIFF files do not use external IVFC level 4, so all database data is
duplicated in the container. In this page only the inner content of the
container is described.

These files are only created on SD (via AM) if they don't exist when the eShop
application is starting up, during network init etc (prior to showing the
"system update required" dialog).



## 3ds:\dbs\title.db (can contain max 1379 files)



## sd:\Nintendo 3DS\\<ID0>\\<ID1>\dbs\title.db


Title database, contains entries for all installed titles (TWL & CTR) on
the 3DS (each database is responsible for titles installed on its medium).



## 3ds:\dbs\import.db



## sd:\Nintendo 3DS\\<ID0>\\<ID1>\dbs\import.db


Import Databases, containing entries for titles (or versions of titles) not yet
installed, ready for transferring to the title.db. ("Automatic Update uses
this, so completing the update takes seconds." uh, why does that take so much
time?)



## 3ds:\dbs\tmp\_t.db


Temporary Title database containing one entry for the currently installed
Download Play Child.



## 3ds:\dbs\tmp\_i.db


Similar to import.db, except it's used in conjunction with tmp\_t.db, for
installing Download Play Children.


The inner content of the container consists of a pre-header with size of 0x80
identifying the Database Type, followed by a BDRI container. The offsets in the
BDRI header are usually relative to the offset to the start of the BDRI header
(0x80 in the file)


Pre Header

```
  000h 8    ID (eg. "NANDTDB",00h) (see below)
  008h 78h  Reserved
  080h ...  BDRI filesystem (with 80h-byte files containing Title Info)
```

The 8-byte ID can be:

```
  ID="NANDIDB",00h --> 3ds:\dbs\import.db
  ID="NANDTDB",00h --> 3ds:\dbs\title.db
  ID="TEMPIDB",00h --> 3ds:\dbs\tmp_i.db, tmp_t.db
  ID="TEMPTDB",00h --> sd:\Nintendo 3DS\<ID0>\<ID1>\dbs\import.db, title.db
```

TMD.

```



## Notes


"It is important to note the database doesn't contain a hash of the .cmd. So if
a user has more than one valid set of application data for a given .cmd Content
ID they can be manually interchanged without issue. Though renaming a .cmd file
to match the Content ID which the title.db is expecting will result in an
error, as the CTR for the per-console encryption layer changes depending on the
file path, and the MAC of the .cmd is probably generated with the .cmd Content
ID in mind."


"These NAND/SD /dbs images seem to be loaded by the ARM9 while NATIVE\_FIRM is
booting."


"Removing ticket.db from a New3DS with signature checks disabled will not
result in an unbootable system, however all icons except Slot-1 will disappear
from Home. Applets can however still be used. Recovery can be accomplished via
hardmod or arm9loaderhax plus a known good backup of the file (or the whole
partition or disk); Gamecard exploits were not tested, and Browserhax did not
work."

  RSA-2048 for TMD signature      (Retail=CP0000000b, or Dev=CP0000000a)
```

The same three certificates are also stored in certs.db,

- [3DS Files - Title Certificates (certs.db)](#3dsfilestitlecertificatescertsdb)


## Ticket (350h bytes), with decrypt key for APP file(s)


- [3DS Files - Title Ticket (ticket.db)](#3dsfilestitleticketticketdb)


## TMD (B34h+N\*30h bytes), contains info about the separate APP file(s)


- [3DS Files - Title Metadata (TMD)](#3dsfilestitlemetadatatmd)


## APP file(s)


This region can contain one or more contents (eg. separate .app files for
executable and manual, with .app sizes as listed in the TMD file; the .app
files can be 3DS NCCH images, or DSiware images, or DSi datafiles like DS Cart
Whitelist).

The .app contents are usually encrypted using the ticket's titlekey (see the
Ticket chapter for details).

```
  There are two unencrypted variants:
  1) Encryption can be disabled in Content Type flags in the TMD file (that's
     done in most or all homebrew CIA's like ctrQuake.cia)
  2) Pre-retail prototype CIA's from mid 2010 didn't include tickets, and are
     thus unencrypted (the Ticket Size entry in CIA header is probably zero?)
```

## Meta (8 bytes) (CVer USA)


Seems to contain a copy of the "CVer - RomFS:\version.bin" file.

- [3DS Files - Version (CVer and NVer)](#3dsfilesversioncverandnver)
Confusingly, the japanese system update contains 000400db00017202.cia (that
name would be CVer USA, but the file contains CVer JPN). And confusingly, the
system update doesn't contain any NVer file (unknown if/how it is updating
NVer).



## APP Flags


This appears to be a 64Kbit array with flags for Content Index 0000h..FFFFh
(the first flag for index 0000h being located in bit7 of first byte).

The number of contents and content indices are found in the TMD file (most
titles have only 1 or 2 contents, so the first flag byte is usually 80h or C0h,
followed by 1FFFh zero bytes).

Unknown if these flags are used for anything... maybe there are cases where the
TMD lists multiple APPs, but only one of them being updated in the CIA?


```

## Overview


CIA format allows the installation of titles to the 3DS. CIA files and titles
on Nintendo's CDN contain identical data. As a consequence, valid CIA files can
be generated from CDN content. This also means CIA files can contain anything
that titles on Nintendo's CDN can contain. Uh, what is a CDN?


Under normal circumstances CIA files are used where downloading a title is
impractical or not possible. Such as distributing a Download Play child, or
installing forced Gamecard updates. Those CIA(s) are stored by the titles in
question, in an auxiliary CFA file.


Development Units, are capable of manually installing CIA files via the Dev
Menu.



## Format


The CIA format has a similar structure to the Wii's WAD format (aka DSi Tad?).

The file is represented in little-endian.

The data is aligned in 40h-byte blocks (if a content ends at the middle of the
block, the next content will begin from a new block).


```
 _____________________________ System Update CFA ______________________________
```


This system update CFA contains the below files in the RomFS. This CFA is
stored in the NCSD system-update partition (partition 7), the data from this
CFA RomFS can also be transferred for Download Play when the client needs
updated.

```
  ROM Cart NCSD Partition 6, NCCH RomFS:\SNAKE\cup_list  ;\New3DS System Update
  ROM Cart NCSD Partition 6, NCCH RomFS:\SNAKE\*.cia     ;/
  ROM Cart NCSD Partition 7, NCCH RomFS:\cup_list        ;\Old3DS System Update
  ROM Cart NCSD Partition 7, NCCH RomFS:\*.cia           ;/
```



## cup\_list


This uses the same format as the CVer cup\_list, this system-update CFA cup\_list
contains the titleIDs for all of the titles stored in this RomFS.

- [3DS Files - Version (CVer and NVer)](#3dsfilesversioncverandnver)


## \<titleID>.cia


This is the CIA for each system-update title, for retail gamecards these CIAs
are generated from the titles available on CDN at the time the NCSD image was
finalized. The latest version(at the time of CFA generation) of every system
title from CDN is stored here, excluding titles with the title-versions for
1.0.0-0.



## New3DS


New3DS system-update partitions are located at partition6 in gamecards. The
RomFS contains a "SNAKE" directory, the contents of that directory have the
same structure as the Old3DS sysupdate CFA RomFS.

  * Zero Data (aka dummy TMD?)
  * Zero Data (aka dummy Meta?) (but here with Meta in front of APP area!?)
  * APP file data (unencrypted, as there's no ticket with titlekey)
```

Only one executable supported. Uh, are there MORE than one "executable"
supported in later versions??? With different title IDs??? But that would
somewhat require multiple TMD's and Ticket's?



## 06/07/2010 - CTR\_SDK: 0\_10\_2


```
  000h 4     Archive Header Size (Usually = 0x2020 bytes)
  004h 2     Type
  006h 2     Version
  008h 4     Unused (aka size=0, or what?)           (no Cert)
  00Ch 4     Ticket size
  010h 4     TMD file size
  014h 4     Unused (aka size=0, or what?)           (no Meta)
  018h 8     APP file size
  020h 2000h Content Index
```

The order of the sections in the CIA file:

```
  * Header
  * Ticket
  * TMD
  * APP file data
```

Very similar to the final CIA version (encryption, TMD, etc), except there is
no embedded Certificate Chain.



## Late 2010


The final version was invented in late 2010 (and, with the 3DS being released
in 2011, retail CIA's are probably always using the final version).




# <a name="3dsfilestitlehomebrewexecutables3dsx"></a>3DS Files - Title Homebrew Executables (3DSX)



The 3DSX format is a homebrew executable file format. The main feature is
having relocateable code, which may have been required for some older exploits
that didn't provide full control of the virtual memory mapping.

As such, the .3dsx format is no longer useful (at least not once when having
installed a bootloader), and one could instead use regular .code, .firm, .ncch,
or .cia files for homebrew.



## 3DSX File Format


Header:

```
  00h  4   ID "3DSX"
  04h  2   Header size (20h or 2Ch)
  06h  2   Relocation Header size (unspecified purpose) (always 8)
  08h  4   Format version         (unspecified purpose) (always 0)
  0Ch  4   Flags                  (unspecified purpose) (always 0)
  10h  4   Code Segment Size
  14h  4   Rodata Segment Size
  18h  4   Data Segment Size (including bss)
  1Ch  4   Bss Segment Size
```

Extended Header (when [04h]>20h):

```
 (20h) 4   Icon/Title Offset       (or ?=None)
 (24h) 4   Icon/Title Size (36C0h) (or ?=None)
 (28h) 4   RomFS Offset            (or 0=None)
```

Relocation Header(s)

```
  ..   4   Number of absolute Code relocations   (=maybe num skip/patch pairs?)
  ..   4   Number of relative Code relocations   (unknown purpose, always 0)
  ..   4   Number of absolute Rodata relocations (=maybe num skip/patch pairs?)
  ..   4   Number of relative Rodata relocations (unknown purpose, always 0)
  ..   4   Number of absolute Data relocations   (=maybe num skip/patch pairs?)
  ..   4   Number of relative Data relocations   (unknown purpose, always 0)
```

Segments

```
  ..   ..  Code Segment
  ..   ..  Rodata Segment
  ..   ..  Data Segment (whatever... maybe excluding bss?)
```

Relocation Tables

```
  ..   ..  Code Relocation Table
  ..   ..  Rodata Relocation Table
  ..   ..  Data Relocation Table
```

Optional (when [04h]>20h):

```
  ..   ..  Icon/Title (SMDH Format)
  ..   ..  RomFS      (RomFS Directory/File area, without IVFC header+SHA's)
```

Unknown how the executable could access the RomFS (it might be loaded to some
RAM address, which would be a waste of memory) (or otherwise the executable
would need to know the path\filename of the 3dsx file).



## Relocation Table (entries?):


```
  00h  2   Number of words to skip
  02h  2   Number of words to patch
```

Unknown what this does. The file is probably meant to be originated at a fixed
base address (maybe zero?), and one would add the actual load address to any
such "absolute" addresses? And do whatever on "relative" addresses?

# <a name="3dsfilesclientcertkeyclcerta"></a>3DS Files - Client Cert/Key (ClCertA)



ClCertA (title id: 0004001b00010002) contains the following encrypted files:

```

  RomFS:ctr-common-1-key.bin    ;default SSL client private key
```

The .bin files are AES-CBC encrypted using keyslot 0Dh (as set by bootrom):

# <a name="3dsfilesctcert"></a>3DS Files - CTCert



Below seems to describe "CTCert".

Uh, unknown if/where this "CTCert" is stored?

Maybe it exists only after having connected to the shop at least once (similar
to DSi's dev.kp)?

Or maybe it's a slightly reformatted copy of the Decrypted OTP, maybe only
temporarily stored in RAM?

Or maybe below does describe .ctx file format rather than CTCert format?


The console-unique CTCert is used for signing CTX files (uh, really signing
them? with a public key??), the DeviceCert used by eShop, and for DSiWare
exports. This ECDSA signature, the ECDSA private key for this cert, and the
IssuerID is loaded from memory initialized by bootrom instead of NAND. This is
the 3DS equivalent of the DSi TWCert (aka the "TW cert" in DSi "Tad" files?).


The CTCert is signed with ECDSA by Nintendo. CTCerts can be verified via a DER
stored in NATIVE\_FIRM, separate DERs are used for retail and dev/debug.



## Structure


```
  000h 4     Signature Type (00010005h)
  004h 3Ch   Signature ECDSA
  040h 40h   Signature padding/alignment (zerofilled)
  080h 40h   Signature Name (retail="Nintendo CA - G3_NintendoCTR2prod")
                            (dev="Nintendo CA - G3_NintendoCTR2dev")
  0C0h 4     Key Type
  0C4h 40h   Key Name "CT<DeviceId>-<ConsoleType>"  aka "CTxxxxxxxx-xx"?
               DeviceId is the hex DeviceId (aka Decrypted OTP[04h..07h]?)
               ConsoleType is "00"=retail, "01"=dev
  104h 04    Key Expiration UNIX Time, big endian (seconds since 1 Jan 1970 ?)
  108h 3Ch   Key Public ECDSA Key (point X,Y)
               "This is two consecutive u8 arrays (each one of length 1Eh),
               where the first one corresponds to the ECDSA R coordinate,
               and the second to ECDSA S coordinate. These are in big endian."
  144h 3Ch   Key padding/alignment (zerofilled)
```


The ECDSA public key for this cert is converted from the ECDSA private key
initialized by bootrom (uh, that's probably meant to be from Decrypted OTP).
The curve used for ECDSA is sect233r1.




# <a name="3dsfilesdictionarynjdc"></a>3DS Files - Dictionary (NJDC)



NJDC files contain dictionaries (maybe for spellchecking?), NJDC files are
found in:

- Shared Data Archives: Dictionary (RomFS:\..\\*.a) ;for console/region languages
- System Applets: 3DS Browser applet (RomFS:\iwnn\..\\*.a) ;for all languages



## Dictionary Format


The files contain a header and several large tables. The header size (and the
location/presence of the header entries) varies from file to file; possibly
depending on some header flags?

All values, offsets and UTF-16 chars are BIG-ENDIAN.

```
  000h 4    Header ID ("NJDC")
  004h 2    Unknown (1 or 2)
  006h 2    Unknown (0 or 1)
  008h 2    Unknown (4 or 5 or 0Fh)
  00Ah 2    Unknown (0)
  00Ch 4    Total Filesize minus a few bytes?
  010h 4    Unknown (00xxh)
  014h 4+4  Unknown (00xxh,00xxh) (usually both the same value)
  01Ch 4    Unknown (00xxh)
  ...  ..   ???
  ...  4    Offset to 10-byte Table
  ...  4    Offset to UTF-16 Strings
  ...  4    Offset to 2-byte Table
  ..   ..   Some zeroes and offsets?
  ...  4    Offset to 2 bytes? (08h,06h)
  ...  4    Values 00h,01h,01h,01h
  ...  4    Values 00h,01h,01h,01h
  ...  ..   ???
  ...  4    Number of words (N) ?
  ...  ..   ???
  ...  ..   4-byte Table (maybe some lookup table?)
  ...  2    2 bytes? (08h,06h)
  ...  N*10 10-byte Table (see below)
  ...  ..   UTF-16 Strings (raw strings, without trailing zeroes)
  ...  N*2  2-byte Table (values 0101h*(40h..7Dh)?) (flags/lookup?) (if any)
  ...  4    Footer ID ("NJDC") (can be unaligned)
```

10-byte Table:

```
  000h 1    String Length in bytes (always even, since chars are UTF-16)
  001h 3    String Offset (relative to String Table base)
  004h 6    Zerofilled
```



## Bad Word List


Roughly related, there is Bad Word list in

```
  System Data Archives 2, NGWord (RomFS:*.txt)
```

The .txt files are UTF-16 (starting with FFh,FEh byte-order-marker).




# <a name="3dsfilesguidegbin"></a>3DS Files - Guide (GBIN)



GBIN Files are found in 3DS Camera & 3DS Sound (RomFS:\res\Guide\*.gbin).

The files contain several "T\_xxx" and "D\_xxx\_y" strings, bundled with unknown
small numbers.

Purpose is unknown, maybe some Tree structure, or a list of Chapters (T) and
Pages (D).

The files contain no real data, so they do probably refer to whatever other
files, ie. translating names to file indices and/or assigning attributes.



## GBIN Format


```
  000h 4     ID "GBIN"
  004h 4     Number of GUID entries
  008h ..    GUID entries
```

GUID entry format:

```
  000h 4     ID "GUID"
  004h 4     Number of D-entries
  008h 4     Unknown (0 or 1 or 2)
  00Ch 4     Unknown (0 or 1 or 2)
  010h 4     Unknown (0..0Fh?)
  014h 0Ch   Unknown (0)
  020h 10h   T-Name ("T_001" and up, zeropadded)
  030h N*14h D-Entries
```

D-Entry Format:

```
  000h 10h   D-NAME ("D_001_0" and up, zeropadded)
  010h 4     Unknown (0..04h?)
```




# <a name="3dsfilesversioncverandnver"></a>3DS Files - Version (CVer and NVer)




## 3ds:\title\000400db System Data Archives 2 - NVer and CVer


```

  CVer - RomFS:\titleversion.txt   ;exists in 9.6.0-X and up             ;/
```

See also:

- [3DS Files - FIRM Versions](#3dsfilesfirmversions)
- [http://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Home\_Menu](http://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Home_Menu) \<-- more versions!



## NVer - RomFS:\version.bin (8 bytes)


This 8-byte file mainly contains the system revision number, for the version
number displayed by System Settings. The rest of the data used for the system
version is contained in CVer.

```
  000h 2     Reserved (0)
  002h 1     Revision version number (0..45) (the version's -N suffix)
  003h 1     Reserved (0)
  004h 1     ASCII character for the system version region (eg. "J"=Japan)
  005h 3     Reserved (0)
```

Note: The NVer "revision" number does usually increase alongsides with the
"major.minor" number in CVer (but some updates have only either one of those
increased) (unknown why, maybe one file refers to FIRM version, and the other
to Kernel version or whatever).



## CVer - RomFS:\version.bin (8 bytes)


This 8-byte file contains most of the data used for displaying the system
version in System Settings. Format of the system version:
"major.minor.build-revision region".

```
  000h 1     Build version number (0)
  001h 1     Minor version number (0..13)
  002h 1     Major version number (1..11)
  003h 1     Reserved (0)
  004h 1     ASCII character for the system version region (eg. "J"=Japan)
  005h 3     Reserved (zeroes, or same as [000h..002h])
```



## CVer - RomFS:\cup\_list (800h bytes) (exists only before 8.0.0-18)


```
  000h N*8   TitleID list of system titles (8 bytes each)   ;eg. 127 titles
  ...  ..    Zerofilled (padding to 800h-byte filesize)
```

This list doesn't contain all system titles, though most are contained in this
list.

This file was removed from the CDN CVer RomFS, starting with 8.0.0-18.

A similar "cup\_list" file is bundled with System Update CIA's:

- [3DS Files - Title Installation Archive (CIA)](#3dsfilestitleinstallationarchivecia)


## CVer - RomFS:\masterkey.bin (40h bytes, exists in 7.2.0-17 and up)


```
  000h 1     Region (00h=Japan, 01h=USA, 02h=EUR, etc.)
  001h 1     Version (0Ah=v7.2, 0Bh=v8.0, etc.)
  002h 0Eh   Zerofilled
  010h 10h   AES IV value for decrypting below key
  020h 20h   Encrypted HMAC key
```

This file is used by System Settings. The HMAC key is decrypted using AES-CTR
using a key from "mset .rodata" and the above IV value.



## CVer - RomFS:\titleversion.txt (ASCII 5-7 bytes) (exists in 9.6.0-X and up)


With 9.6.0-X, this is a 5-byte file containing the following: "9.6.7". This is
the parsed version of the CVer TMD title-version.

After USA 9.6.0-X for \<=v11.0, this matches the version from CVer
version.bin.




# <a name="3dsfilescrr0andcro0files"></a>3DS Files - CRR0 and CRO0 Files



CRO0 and CRR0 files are reportedly somehow related, but unknown how exactly.

```
  System Tools: Nintendo Network ID Settings and System Applets: Miiverse have
    "RomFS:\.crr\static.crr" ;-CRR0 (whatever)
    "RomFS:\cro\static.crs"  ;-CRO0 (without actual code/data in there)

CRO with extension .cro is used for "DLLs". CRS with extension .crs is in the
same format of CRO but storing the symbol information of the static module (the

.crs files seem to contain only symbols and stuff (and empty code/data

ARM32 branch instruction is constructed as follows:

```
  If addend > 02000000h or addend < FE000000h, then skip.
  If (addend&1) == 1 then write "b +4" (nop).
  Else write as normal.
```

Unknown what "addend" means... addition offset? end of addition?


When the RO module loads the entire CRO into process memory (mapped in the
00100000h-04000000h region), it modifies the mapped CRO data. The magic field
is also changed to "FIXD" if fix level is not 0.


Upon loading, the RO module will look for export symbol "nnroAeabiAtexit\_" to
patch it to its import symbol "\_\_aeabi\_atexit".




# <a name="3dsfilesarchivedarc"></a>3DS Files - Archive DARC



DARC archives are used in various places, sometimes uncompressed, or often with
LZSS or LZ11 compression. For example,

```
  Uncompressed DARC     Manual.bcma file (e-manual)
  LZSS compressed DARC  .arc files (nested within above .bcma file)
  LZ11 compressed DARC  NCCH Logo (in NCCH Header, or NCCH ExeFS:\logo)
  LZ11 compressed DARC  .arc.LZ files (eg. in 3DS Camera RomFS "lyt" folder)
```

The DARC format is about same as the Wii's U8 format (with different header,
different byte-order, and UTF-16 instead of ASCII names).



## DARC header


```
  000h 4    ID "darc"
  004h 2    Byte Order (FEFFh)
  006h 2    Header Size (001Ch)
  008h 4    Version (01000000h)
  00Ch 4    Total Filesize (excluding trailing 20h-byte SHA256-HMAC, if any)
  010h 4    Offset of File/Folder List (usually 1Ch)
  014h 4    Size of File/Folder List, PLUS File/Folder Name Area
  018h 4    Offset of File Data Area
  ..   ..   File/Folder List (0Ch bytes per file/folder)
  ..   ..   File/Folder Name Area (UTF-16)
  ..   ..   File Data Area (usually each file is 20h-byte aligned)
 (..) (20h) Trailing SHA256-HMAC, if any (this is NOT 20h-byte aligned)
```



## Root/Dot Entries (first 1-2 entries in File/Folder List)


```
  Entry0: Type=Folder, Name="", Offset=0, End=TotalNumDirEntries  ;Root
  Entry1: Type=Folder, Name=".", Offset=0, End=TotalNumDirEntries ;Dot (if any)
```

Entry0/Root is important to know the total directory size, and to compute the
begin of the Name Area:

```
  NameArea = FileFolderList + TotalNumDirEntries*0Ch
```

Entry1/Dot is somewhat useless, but it does exist in most (not all) darc files,
ie. the path strings can appear as so:

```
  darc:\.\dir\subdir\file       ;<-- ugly, but used in most darc files
  darc:\dir\subdir\file         ;<-- nicer, used in a few darc files
```

It's best to hide the "." in path strings (ie. detect if Entry1 is a Folder,
with name "." and same Offset/End as Entry0, and if so, skip/ignore it).



## File/Folder List Entries (0Ch bytes per entry)


```
  000h 3    Name offset (24bit, relative to begin of Name Area)
  003h 1    Type        (00h=File, 01h=Folder)
 When Type=00h=File:
  004h 4    File offset (relative to begin if darc; NOT to begin of Data Area)
  008h 4    File size
 When Type=01h=Folder:
  004h 4    Folder Parent Index (0=Root, 1=Dot, Other=NestedSubdir's)
  008h 4    Folder End Index (entries up to excluding End Index are childs)
```



## Special Cases


3DS Face Raiders RomFS:\hal\effect\kbb\kbb.dat doesn't have a "." dot folder.

3DS Mii Maker RomFS:\shaders\shader.arc has nested folders & empty folders.

3DS Activity Log RomFS:\P\_UlcdTest\_LZ.bin contains an empty darc.

# <a name="3dsfilesarchivesarc"></a>3DS Files - Archive SARC



SARC archives contain only files, not folders. However, the filenames do
usually contain slashes (eg. "bsnd/cursor.bcwav"), so software could split
those names into folder+filename, if desired.

SARC is used by 3DS eShop Applet, RomFS:\layout\ and RomFS:\sound\.



## SARC Header


```
  000h 4     ID "SARC"
  004h 2     Header Size (14h)
  006h 2     Byte Order (FEFFh)
  008h 4     Total Filesize
  00Ch 4     Data Offset (aka Size of SARC+SFAT+SFNT)
  010h 2     Unknown/version? (always 0100h)
  012h 2     Unknown/reserved? (0)
  ..   ..    SFAT Chunk (see below) (Directory)
  ..   ..    SFNT Chunk (see below) (Filename strings)
  ..   ..    Data
```



## SFAT Chunk (File Allocation Table)


```
  000h 4     ID "SFAT"
  004h 2     Header Size (0Ch)
  006h 2     Number of FAT Entries
  008h 4     Filename Hash Multiplier (usually 65h)
  00Ch N*10h FAT Entries (10h bytes each)
```

FAT Entry Format:

```
  000h 4    Filename Checksum (sorted, with smallest checksum in 1st FAT entry)
  004h 2    Filename Offset (at SFNT+8+Offset*4)
  006h 2    File Attribute? (always 0100h)
  008h 4    File Data Start (at Data+Start)
  00Ch 4    File Data End   (at Data+End, aka Data+Start+Size)
```

The filename checksums are calculated as follows:

```
  sum=0, for i=0 to namelen-1, sum=(sum*hash_multiplier)+name[i], next i
```



## SFNT Chunk (Filename Table)


```
  00h 4    ID "SFNT"
  04h 2    Header Length (08h)
  06h 2    Unknown (padding?)
  08h ..   Filenames (ASCII, terminated by zero, on 4-byte boundaries)
```



## File Data (at Offset specified in SARC[0Ch])


Files are at least 4-byte aligned (some SARCs do reportedly use 80h-byte
alignment).



## Tools


SARC Extractor/Creator with TAR-like command line flags. Can decompress a .zlib
SARC file (4-byte size header + ZLIB data).




# <a name="3dsfilesarchivearcless"></a>3DS Files - Archive arcless




## arcless Format


This is a very simple archive format, found in some LZ-compressed files, eg. in
3DS Sound and 3DS Camera (RomFS:\lyt\C.LZ and RomFS:\shaders\shaders.LZ), 3DS
Picture Picker (RomFS:\sound\csnd.LZ), and also in uncompressed form, eg. 3DS
Sound (RomFS:\res\S.pack).

```
  000h+N*40h 38h     Filename (ASCII, zeropadded)                      ;\
  038h*N*40h 4       File Offset (always 80h-aligned)                  ;
  03Ch*N*40h 4       File Size                                         ; header
  ..         1       Zero (indicates end of directory)                 ;
  ..         ..      Zeropadding to 80h-byte boundary                  ;/
  xxx*80h    ..      File data (at above offsets)                      ;\data
  ..         ..      Zeropadding to 80h-byte boundary, after each file ;/
```

The header doesn't contain any ID (like "NARC", "SARC", or "darc" or so).
However, one can more or less reliably detect it by checking for valid ASCII
characters, zeropaddings, 1st Offset being located after the directory, further
Offsets being located at Offset+Size+Alignment from previous entry, and with
Offset+Size not exceeding the archive size.




# <a name="3dsfilesarchivezar"></a>3DS Files - Archive ZAR




## ZAR Format (Zelda Archive, used in 3DS Zelda Ocarina of Time)


```
  000h 4      ID "ZAR",01h                                   ;\
  004h 4      Total Filesize                                 ;

  ...  F*8    Filesize/Filename Entries                      ;\
  ...  ..     Filenames (ASCII, terminated by zero)          ; file list
  ...  F*4    Fileoffset Entries                             ;/
  ...  ..     File data...                                   ;-file data
```



## Filetypes Entries


```
  000h 4    Number of Files for the Filetype (0=None)
  004h 4    Offset to File List for the Filetype (FFFFFFFFh=None)
  008h 4    Offset to Filetype name (eg. "unknown",0 or "zsi",0 etc.)
  00Ch 4    Unknown (always FFFFFFFFh)
```

The File List contains a list of 32bit File indices for the Filetype (0=1st
file, 1=2nd file, etc).

The number of filetypes varies between 2 and 8 in known files. Known filetype
names are:

```
  "anb",00h       boy/.../*.anb    ;eg. in actor\zelda_link_child_ultra.zar
  "ccb",00h       ?
  "cmab",00h      misc/.../*.cmab
  "cmb",00h       Model/.../*.cmb  (or lowercase, model/.../*.cmb)
  "csab",00h      Anim/.../*.csab
  "ctxb",00h      tex/.../*.ctxb
  "faceb",00h     boy/.../*.faceb  ;eg. in actor\zelda_link_opening.zar
  "qdb",00h       demo/.../*.qdb   ;eg. in actor\zelda_horse.zar, scene\*.zar
  "tbd",00h       txt/.../*.tbd    ;eg. in kankyo\kankyo_common.zar
  "unknown",00h   Anim/.../*.cskla ;eg. in actor/zelda_magic_wind.zar
  "zsi",00h       collision/.../*.zsi
```

Type "unknown" does always exist as first type entry (even if it contains no
files; the only archive containing an "unknown" file is
actor/zelda\_magic\_wind.zar, which contains Anim/new\_magic\_wind.cskla).



## Filesize/Filename Entries


```
  000h 4    File size
  004h 4    Offset to filename (ASCII, terminated by zero)
```



## Fileoffset Entries


```
  000h 4    Offset to File data
```



## Directories


The ZAR format doesn't directly support directories. However, most filenames
contain slashes so one could split those into folder/filename.

Note: RomFS:\scene\\*.zar does use "\" backslashes instead of "/" slashes, that,
with some names starting with dot or dotdot (".\" or  "..\..\").

If desired, one could also treat the ZAR's Filetypes section as top-level
directories, or as filetype suffix (although "Model" and ".cmb" in filenames
like "Model\filename.cmb" do already imply the type anyways).



## Note


See 
- [https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Category:File\_Formats](https://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Category:File_Formats) for more Zelda fileformats (QBF, QCL, QM, etc).




# <a name="3dsfilesccalformathardwarecalibrationhwcal"></a>3DS Files - CCAL Format (Hardware calibration, HWCAL)



The two HWCAL files contain (initial?) calibration values, the data is also
stored in the system settings config file, unknown which of those three files
contains the most up to date values for daily use.

- [3DS Files - Config Savegame](#3dsfilesconfigsavegame)


## Reading


"If 0x1FF81006 (uh, what, where from?) is 3 or 4 or 7 or 8 or 9 then the
calibration data is read from the EEPROM using the i2c:EEP service command
0x001000C0, using offset 0x000 for HWCAL0, and offset 0x800 for HWCAL1.
Otherwise attempt is made to read CTRNAND:/ro/sys/HWCAL(0|1).dat instead."

The HMAC key for header signature is unknown.

The Checksum function is unknown (for 1-2 byte sections it's just the 1-2
byte(s) XORed FFh).

The purpose of most entries is unknown.

Unknown how to read the EEPROM data (maybe similar as for Wifi EEPROM?).

Unknown what size EEPRM has (apparently at least 1000h bytes).

Unknown if EEPROM has any header (maybe only 30h bytes instead 200h bytes?).




# <a name="3dsfilesconfigsavegame"></a>3DS Files - Config Savegame



This page describes the format of the Cfg NAND savegame. These blocks can be
accessed with the Cfg service commands.


The data is stored in "3ds:\data\\<ID0>\sysdata\00010017\00000000" (which
is a DISA file with SAVE filesystem, containing only one file, ie. the "config"
file described below).



## Structure of save-file "/config"


```
  Offset Size   Description
  0000h  2      Total entries (N) (usually 32h..41h)
  0002h  2      End of unused space, begin of Data (455Ch..41E4h)
  0004h  N*0Ch  Block entries
  ...    ...    Unused space
  455Ch         Data for the entries (used from top, starting at 7FFFh)
```

The filesize for this /config file is 0x8000-bytes.



## Configuration block entry


```
  00h 4  BlkID (00xx000xh)

## Languages


```
  ID      Description (two letter code... and guessed meaning)
  0  =    JP Japanese
  1  =    EN English
  2  =    FR French
  3  =    DE German
  4  =    IT Italian
  5  =    ES Spanish
  6  =    ZH ...maybe a widespread chinese dialect...?
  7  =    KO Korean
  8  =    NL Dutch
  9  =    PT Portugese
  10 =    RU Russian

```



## CountryInfo


```
  00h 1   ?
  01h 1   ?
  02h 1   State/Province code
  03h 1   Country code, same as DSi/Wii country codes. Value 0xFF is invalid.
```



## 0x000A0000 Block


```
  00h 14h  UTF-16 username, with no NULL-terminator (uh, what if shorter?)
  14h 4    Usually zero?
  18h 4    u32 NGWord version the username was last checked with. If this
             value is less than the u32 stored in the NGWord CFA
             "romfs:/version.dat", the system then checks the username
             string with the bad-word list CFA again, then updates this field
             with the value from the CFA
```



## WiFi Slot Structure


```
  000h   2     Unknown? (can be 0001h)
  002h   2     CRC-16 checksum of the next 410h bytes (unknown initial value)
  004h   88h   First network structure. Only set if the network was set
                 "normally", or was the last to be set using WPS during the
                 session
  08Ch   20h   Padding
  0ACh   88h   Second network structure. Only set if the network was set
                 using WPS, otherwise 0-filled
  134h   20Ch  Padding
  340h   1     Obtain IP, Gateway, Subnet (0=Manual, 1=Auto/DHCP)
  341h   1     Obtain DNS Server address  (0=Manual, 1=Auto/DHCP)
  342h   2     Padding ?
  344h   4     IP address               ;\
  348h   4     Gateway                  ; used only if [340h]=00h
  34Ch   4     Subnet Mask              ;/
  350h   4     Primary DNS Server       ;\used only if [341h]=00h
  354h   4     Secondary DNS Server     ;/
  358h   4     Always 0x01050000 ?      ;\     <-- rather 00000001h (!) or 501h
  35Ch   4     IP address to use        ; Only set if the network was the
  360h   6     MAC address of the AP    ; last to be set during the session.
  366h   1     Channel (range ?..?)     ;      <-- can be 06h,0Bh
  367h   1     Padding ?                ;/
  368h   1     Proxy Enable         (00h=None, 01h=Yes)
  369h   1     Proxy Authentication (00h=None, 01h=Yes)
  36Ah   2     Proxy Port (16bit)
  36Ch   30h   Proxy Name (ASCII string, max 47 chars, padded with 00's)
  39Ch   34h   Padding
  3D0h   20h   Proxy Authentication Username (ASCII string, padded with 00's)
  3F0h   20h   Proxy Authentication Password (ASCII string, padded with 00's)
  410h   2     Padding ?
  412h   2     MTU Value (Max transmission unit) (576..1500, usually 1400)
  414h   7ECh  Padding
```

Network structure (used twice in the above WiFi slot structure):

```
  00h   1     Whether the network was set or not?
  01h   1     Whether to use this network structure to connect?
  02h   1     Whether this structure is the first (0) or the second (1) in the
                larger WiFi slot structure?
  03h   1     Padding ?
  04h   20h   SSID (ASCII string, padded with 00's) (see below for length)
  24h   1     SSID Length in characters (01h..20h, or 00h=unused)
  25h   1     AP crypto key type (maybe related to WEP/WPA bytes on NDS?)
  26h   2     Padding ?
  28h   40h   WPA/WPA2 password (ASCII string, padded with 00's)
  68h   20h   Precomputed PSK (based on WPA/WPA2 password and SSID)
```

The above data is (slightly reordered) also stored in Wifi FLASH:

- [DS Firmware Wifi Internet Access Points](ds.html#dsfirmwarewifiinternetaccesspoints)
The DSi did have support for six access points (3xWEP and 3xWEP/WPA), unknown
if the old 3xWEP ones are still supported on 3DS, and if so, if they are also
stored in the Config Samegame file.



## LCD display config


There seems to be some sort of LCD display configuration stored in this cfg.
When using the cfg-save from an Old3DS on a New3DS without formatting the cfg
first, the bottom-screen display is somewhat off (which is fixed by formatting
the cfg-save).



## Parental control Block 0x00100001


```
  00h   0Dh  Unknown
  0Dh   4    PIN
  11h   20h  Secret answer in UTF-16
```



## Parental Control setting block 0xC0000


```
  00h   4    Parental Control restriction bitmask
  04h   ...     ?
  0Ch   4    Parental Controls PIN code

# <a name="3dsfilestitlens"></a>3DS Files - Title NS



System Data Archives NS (titleID=0004001B00010702) contains 2-4 files:

```
  RomFS:\key.bin
  RomFS:\value.bin
  RomFS:\ctr_backup_black_list  ;v6.0.0 and up
  RomFS:\qtm_black_list         ;v8.1.0 and up, New3DS only
```

Most of these files seem to contain 20bit Title IDs, merged with flags in upper
bits. The 20bit IDs are taken from bit8-27 of the full 64bit Title ID:

```
  64bit: "0004xxxxxtttttxx"  -->  20bit: "ttttt"
```

A list with 64bit 3DS Title IDs can be found at 
- [http://www.3dsdb.com/](http://www.3dsdb.com/)


## key.bin


Unknown purpose, used when launching applications, contains several entries
with flags and 20bit title IDs for Ridge Racer and Zelda Ocarina of Time (for
several regions each).

```
  000h N*4  Entries (00Xttttth)
```

Original filesize was 12 bytes, changed to 48 bytes in v6.0.0, and changed to
32 bytes in later New3DS versions (and also changed the flag bits in bit20-23).
The separate entries are:

```

Original filesize was 8 bytes, changed to 32 bytes in v6.0.0, and changed to 16
bytes in later New3DS versions.

- 8-bytes on Old3DS:

This is used when launching applications.



## ctr\_backup\_black\_list (v6.0.0 and up)


Blacklist with 20bit Title IDs for SD Savedata Backups.

```
  000h 4    Number of entries (5Dh in v6.0.0, or 61h in later versions)
  004h 0Ch  Zero
  010h N*4  Entries (001ttttth, with ttttt=00321h..0107Ch)
```



## qtm\_black\_list (v8.1.0 and up, New3DS only)


Might be a list of 20bit Title IDs for disabling QTM (New3DS head-tracking)?

```
  000h 4    Number of entries? (04h)
  004h 0Ch  Zero
  010h N*4  Entries (001F8087h, 004F8088h, 006F8089h, 010F8090h)
```

The 20bit values in range F8000h-FEFFFh are reportedly used for "Evaluation" or
"Factory" titles, rather than retail titles?




# <a name="3dsfilessavedataextdata"></a>3DS Files - Savedata Extdata



Extdata files in FAT filesystem:

```
  ..\00000000\00000001    ;-DIFF:VSXE directory
  ..\00000000\00000002    ;-DIFF:raw_data (usually 1-byte icon?)
  ..\00000000\00000003    ;\
  ..\00000000\00000004    ; DIFF:raw_data (usually user/boss files, if any)
  ..\00000000\ (etc.)     ;/
  ..\Quota.dat            ;-DIFF:raw_data (QUOT, whatever)
```

Example content of the above DIFF:VSXE filesystem:

```
  icon                ;with 64bit VSXE.ID same as DIFI.ID of 00000000\00000002
  boss\               ;usually empty folder (used in SpotPass data)
  user\somefile.dat   ;with 64bit VSXE.ID same as DIFI.ID of 00000000\000000xx
  user\otherfile.bin  ;with 64bit VSXE.ID same as DIFI.ID of 00000000\000000xx
```



"This page describes the format and encryption of extdata, "extra data" stored
on SD card and NAND, at":

```
  3ds:\data\<ID0>\extdata\00048000\
  sd:\Nintendo 3DS\<ID0>\<ID1>\extdata\00000000\
```

"Extdata ID High is always 00000000 for SD, and always 00048000 for eMMC.
Regular apps can only mount SD extdata using the same Extdata ID which is
stored in the CXI exheader. Therefore, regular apps which have the exheader
Extdata ID set to zero can't use extdata. This restriction doesn't apply for
shared extdata with Extdata ID high "bitmask"(=?) 48000h stored on NAND. System
apps with a certain(=?) access right can mount arbitrary extdata. All NAND
extdata is shared extdata, while all SD extdata is normal extdata."



## Quota.dat File (DIFF container with 48h-byte raw data)


```
  000h 4       ID "QUOT"
  004h 4       Version (00030000h)

  044h 4       Zero
```

Quota.dat exists for eMMC shared extdata only (not for SD extdata). The purpose
of the Quota.dat file is unknown (it might be some kind of log file, and/or
containing some settings/limits or so).



## VSXE File System


The extdata\00048000\f00000xx\00000000/00000001 files contain a VSXE filesystem
(inside of the DIFF container).

- [3DS Files - Savedata SAVE/BDRI/VSXE Formats](#3dsfilessavedatasavebdrivsxeformats)
The VSXE format does have file & directory names, but without actually
assigning data clusters to files (instead, VSXE does merely assign ID values to
each "file" - and that ID refers to the DIFF[154h] ID in one of the
extdata\00048000\f00000xx\00000000/000000xx files).



## Virtual File System Structure


When extdata is created, these are always created regardless of whether the
title actually uses them.

```
  /icon  This virtual file contains the extdata icon displayed in data
           management. This icon can only be written to by titles when
           creating extdata, titles would have to recreate extdata to
           change the icon. This file can't be read directly, instead it
           is read via FS:ReadExtSaveDataIcon.
  /user/ This virtual directory contains the title's actual extdata files.
  /boss/ This virtual directory can contain SpotPass content. SpotPass
           content can only be downloaded to this /boss virtual directory.
```


User extdata and SpotPass extdata use separate mount points at /user and /boss.
Therefore one mount can't access the other virtual directory, and also can't
access /icon (the title's SpotPass extdata can be mounted by the title itself,
if it uses SpotPass).



## Extended Banner (optional)


Folder "\user\ExBanner\" can contain optional extended banner files:

```
  \user\ExBanner\COMMON.bin     ;-common data for all regions
  \user\ExBanner\JPN_JP.bin     ;\
  \user\ExBanner\USA_EN.bin     ; per region/language
  etc.                          ;/
```

If present, this banner is displayed instead of the CXI ExeFS banner.

Uh, displayed instead of? Or does it merely replace textures?

  ?        000004aa 000004ab  Nintendo Video Extra Data
```

This is where the video files are stored, and includes the thumbnail, the
description, and possibly some checksum info in each video file stored in the
extdata images. There are always 9 files within the subdirectory "00000000" of
this folder, even without any videos downloaded. The files are "00000001" -
"00000009", and "00000003" - "00000008" have the same filesize of 50.7 MB. It
is possible to restore the older videos by overwriting all the files within
this directory. Provided of course you have made a backup of the files before
hand, by copying all the files within this directory to your computer. As far
I'm aware its not possible to mix and match the files in order to get certain
videos in one grouping, ie. having all 3 Zelda orchestral recordings in one
group of 4 Nintendo videos.

When partition B doesn't exist, directory & file entry tables are allocated
in the data region, and while (uh?) be marked allocated in file allocation
table as if they are two normal files.

However, only continuous allocation has been observed, so directly reading
block\_count \* block\_size bytes from data\_region + starting\_block\_index \*
block\_size should be safe.



## Directory Table


```
  Entry #0     Dummy Entry    (aka entrypoint for unused (deleted?) entries)
  Entry #1     Root Directory (aka entrypoint for used entries)
  Entry #2..X  Sub-directories (used and deleted entries?)
  Entry #Y..Z  Sub-directories (still unused entries?) (zerofilled)
```

Directory Entries:

```
  SAVE VSXE BDRI Siz Content
  000h 000h 000h 4   Directory Index of Parent directory (0=none; in root)
  004h 004h -    16  Directory Name in ASCII, zeropadded (all zero for root)
  014h 014h 004h 4   Directory Index of next sibling directory   (0=none)
  018h 018h 008h 4   Directory Index of first subdirectory       (0=none)
  01Ch 01Ch 00Ch 4   File index of first file in this directory  (0=none)
  020h 020h 010h ..  Padding (0) / zero?
  024h 024h 01Ch 4   Directory Index of next same hash table bucket (0=none)
```

Dummy Directory entries:

```
  SAVE VSXE BDRI Siz Content
  000h 000h 000h 4   Current Total entry count (eg. 2 = Dummy+Root)
  004h 004h 004h 4   Maximum entry count = maximum directory count + 2
  008h 008h 008h ..  Padding / All zero
  024h 024h 01Ch 4   Directory Index of next dummy (=deleted?) entry (0=none)
```

Dummy entries are left there when deleting directories, and reserved for future
use.



## File Table


```
  Entry #0     Dummy Entry
  Entry #1..X  File Entries (used and deleted entries?)
  Entry #Y..Z  File Entries (still unused entries?) (zerofilled)
```

The file entry table is an array of the entry type shown below. It contains
information for each file.

```
  SAVE VSXE BDRI Siz Content
  000h 000h 000h 4   Directory index of Parent Directory
  004h 004h -    16  File Name in ASCII, zeropadded

  01Ch -    014h 4   First cluster-1 (0..N-1 = Cluster 1..N, or 80000000h=None)
  020h -    018h 8   File Size
  -    -    020h 4   Padding?
  -    01Ch -    4   Always 80000000h (extdata has no clusters)
  -    020h -    8   Unique identifier. See Extdata
  028h 028h 024h 4   Padding?
  02Ch 02Ch 028h 4   File Index of next file in same hash table bucket (0=none)
```

Dummy File entries:

```
  SAVE VSXE BDRI Siz Content
  000h 000h 000h 4   Current total entry count (eg. 2=Dummy+OneFile)
  004h 004h 004h 4   Maximum File entry count = maximum file count + 1
  008h 008h 008h ..  Padding (0)
  02Ch 02Ch 028h 4   File Index of the next dummy (=deleted?) entry (0=last)
```

Dummy entries are left there when deleting files, and reserved for future use.



## File Allocation Table (FAT)


The FAT uses 64bit entries, containing the next & previous cluster number
(unlike microsoft FATs, which contain next cluster only).

```
  0-30  Previous Cluster (1..max, or 0=None)
  31    Blah flag (0=No, 1=First cluster, or Second/Last entry of large block)
  32-62 Next Cluster     (1..max, or 0=None)
  63    Multiple flag    (0=No, 1=First entry of Large block)
```

The Multiple flag indicates a large block that consists of more than one
cluster. The first entry in the large block has Multiple=1, the second and last
entry of the large block contain the first/last cluster numbers of the large
block.

- For example, a file using cluster 20, 100-120, 50 (in that order):
  - File List:     Cluster=19 (aka 20-1)           ;-first cluster of file
  - FAT[20]:       Prev=0,   Next=100, Blah=1      ;-cluster 20
  - FAT[100]:      Prev=20,  Next=50,  Multiple=1  ;\
  - FAT[101]:      Prev=100, Next=120, Blah=1      ; cluster 100..120
  - FAT[102..119]: Zero (or garbage?)              ;
  - FAT[120]:      Prev=100, Next=120, Blah=1      ;/
  - FAT[50]:       Prev=100, Next=0                ;-cluster 50

All free blocks that are not allocated to any files also form a node chain in
the allocation table, with starting in FAT[0]:

```
  FAT[0]:        Prev=0, Next=FirstFree    ;-points to begin of free chain
```



## Directory Hash Table & File Hash Table


```
  000h 4   File/Directory Index of 1st name with hash=0
  004h 4   File/Directory Index of 1st name with hash=1
  008h 4   File/Directory Index of 1st name with hash=2
  etc.
```

The hash depends on parent\_directory\_index and file/directory name as key:

```
  hash = parent_dir_index XOR 091A2B3Ch ;-parent mangled with digits 0123+9ABC
  hash = (hash ROR 1) XOR name[00h]     ;\
  hash = (hash ROR 1) XOR name[04h]     ; 16-byte file/directory name
  hash = (hash ROR 1) XOR name[08h]     ; (including trailing 00h's)
  hash = (hash ROR 1) XOR name[0Ch]     ;/
  hash = (hash MOD bucket_count)        ;-final value
```

Uh, but, that cannot be true for BDRI...

```
  BDRI doesn't have any file names (instead has 8-byte Title IDs)
  BDRI doesn't have any directory names
```



## Layout for duplicate data = true


The DISA container only has one partition which is always configured as
external IVFC level 7 disabled (see DISA format for details). All components
are stored in this partition as

- Partition A
  - SAVE/BDRI/VSXE header
  - Directory hash table
  - File hash table
  - File allocation table (FAT)
  - data region
  - directory entry table is allocated inside data region  ;Cluster 1
  - file entry table as well                               ;Cluster 1+x
  - all file data is also allocated here                   ;Cluster 1+x+y
- Partition B
  - none such

In this layout, all data is duplicated by DISA's DPFS tree, which is what the
parameter duplicate data implies.



## Layout for duplicate data = false


The DISA container has two partitions. Partition A is always configured as
external IVFC level 7 disabled, and partition B is configured as it enabled.
Components are stored among the two partitions as

- Partition A
  - SAVE header at the beginning
  - Directory hash table
  - File hash table
  - File allocation table (FAT)
  - directory entry table
  - file entry table
- Partition B
  - used as data region entirely, and only has file data allocated.  ;Cluster 1

In this layout, all file system metadata is duplicated by partition A DPFS
tree, but file data is not as partition B has external IVFC level 7.



## Initialization


When a save FLASH contains all xFFFF blocks it's assumed uninitialized by the
game cartridges and it initializes default data in place, without prompting the
user. The FFFFFFFFh blocks are uninitialized data. When creating a non-gamecard
savegame and other images/files, it's initially all FFFFFFFFh until it's
formatted where some of the blocks are overwritten with encrypted data.



## Tools


3dsfuse supports reading and modifying savegames. In the mounted FUSE
filesystem, the /output.sav is the raw FLASH save-image. When the save was
modified, a separate tool to update the CMAC must be used with /clean.sav,
prior to writing output.sav to a gamecard.

3DSExplorer supports reading of savegames, it doesn't support reading the new
encrypted savegames and maybe in the future it will support modifying (some of
the modyfing code is already implemented).

wwylele's 3ds-save-tool supports extracting files from savegames and extdata.
It properly reconstructs data from the DPFS tree and extracts files in
directories hierarchy.

3dsfuse-ex similar to 3dsfuse, but supports savegame inner FS, proper DPFS
handling, and automatic CMAC update. Still WIP.




# <a name="3dsfilessavedatadisaanddiff"></a>3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF



DISA and DIFF are two container formats (usually containing SAVE/BDRI/VSXE
filesystems, or raw data in some cases).

The DISA/DIFF containers are storing everything in data pairs that consist of
active/inactive halves (somewhat maintaining a backup copy in the active half,
whilst allowing to write new data to the inactive half). Additionally, there
are SHA256's for all data blocks (for error checking, and for preventing
hacks/patches when not having the AES-CMAC key for the master checksum).



## Duplicated Data Pairs


One can safely overwrite the inactive halves (whilst other tasks could still
read the old intact data, and without risking to destroy the active data if the
console crashes during writing), and finally apply the changes by toggling the
active half flags.

The disadvantages are that the duplicated data requires twice as much memory,
crawling through the 7 levels does hurt read/write access time, writing the 7
levels does reduce the chip lifetime, the DIFI's and DPFS level 1-2 are using
the same 200h-byte sector for active/inactive halves (so write errors on that
sectors would also destroy the old active data).

The whole concept is either blatant nonsense, or incredibly clever (in case
Nintendo should have somehow estimated that the few benefits are outweighting
the many disadvanges).



## Variants with Duplicated or Non-duplicated Data


1) Single Partition with Internal Level 7 (duplicated data)

2) Single Partition with External Level 7 (non-duplicated data)

3) Dual Partition (one Internal and one External for partially-duplicated data)

4) DIFF:VSXE directory file, with data stored in separate DIFF:data files


```
        XXX extdata\..\Quota.dat         has external IVFC
        XXX extdata\..\00000000\00000002 has external IVFC
```



## Format


A DISA / DIFF file consists of the following components:

```
  0000h 200h  Header (DISA or DIFF)
  0200h 130h  1st DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for Partition A
                (and somewhere DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for Partition B, if any?)
  0330h 130h  2nd DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for Partition A (as above)
  1000h ...   Partition A
  xxxxh ...   Partition B (optional, can only exist for DISA, not for DIFF).
```



## Encryption


DISA and DIFF formats don't have their own encryption specification. They
follow the encryption method defined by their media:

```
  - Gamecard savegames have special wear leveling + encryption layers.
  - Files on SD follow the general SD filesystem encryption rule.
  - Files on NAND are in cleartext, after decrypting the NAND partition.
```



## DISA header (used for Savegame and System savedata)



## DIFF header (for Extdata and Title Database)


All offsets in the header are relative to the beginning of the DISA/DIFF file,
except for partition descriptor offsets, which are relative to the beginning of
the (active) partition table.

When the partition count is 1, there is no partition B and all of its related
fields are zero.



## DIFI table


All offsets are relative to the beginning of the DIFI partition descriptor,
except for External IVFC level 7 offset, which is relative to the beginning of
the partition.

```
  000h 8     ID "DIFI",00h,00h,01h,00h
  008h 8     IVFC descriptor offset (44h) ;\checksum tree SHA256's   ;"IVFC"
  010h 8     IVFC descriptor size   (78h) ;/
  018h 8     DPFS descriptor offset (BCh) ;\active/inactive data pair flags
  020h 8     DPFS descriptor size   (50h) ;/
  028h 8     SHA256 Partition hash offset (10Ch) ;\aka "Partition master hash"?
  030h 8     SHA256 Partition hash size  (20h*N) ;/
  038h 1     IVFC level 7 location (0=Internal, Nonzero=External) (usually 0)

  10Ch 20h*N SHA256 Partition master hash list (SHA's for Level 4)
  (then followed by another DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for partition B, if any?)
```

Note: There are two DIFI tables (the active one being selected in
DISA[168h]/DIFF[130h]). Both DIFI's are usually containing the exact same
offsets and sizes (and do differ only by Flag in DIFI[039h] and the SHA's at
DIFI[10Ch]) (however, the inactive DIFI may initially contain unformatted
garbage).



## DPFS descriptor


This header defines each level of DPFS tree. All offsets are relative to the
beginning of the partition.

```
  000h 8   ID "DPFS",00h,00h,01h,00h
  008h 8   Level 1 offset        (usually 0)                     ;\Flags for
  010h 8   Level 1 size per half (usually 4, or N*4 if bigger)   ; Level 2
  018h 8   Level 1 block size    (unused, usually 0)             ;/
  020h 8   Level 2 offset        (usually N*4*2, at level 1 end) ;\Flags for
  028h 8   Level 2 size per half (usually 80h*N)                 ; Level 3
  030h 8   Level 2 block size    (1 SHL N, usually 7=80h bytes)  ;/
  038h 8   Level 3 offset        (usually 1000h-aligned)         ;\IVFC's
  040h 8   Level 3 size per half (usually 1000h*N)               ; (SHA's+Data)
  048h 8   Level 3 block size  (1 SHL N, usually 12=1000h bytes) ;/
```

The flags are stored in 32bit snippets, weirdly with bit31 being the 1st block
(that can be resolved as "BitNumber=BlockNumber XOR 1Fh"). The flags are
selecting the active half of the next level (0=1st Half, or 1=2nd Half).

The above DPFS "size" values refer to "one half" (the 1st half is at "offset",
the 2nd half is at "offset+size").

## IVFC descriptor


This header defines each level of IVFC tree. All offsets are relative to

the beginning of the active half of DPFS level 3.

```
  000h 8   ID "IVFC",00h,00h,02h,00h
  008h 8   Master hash size = partition master hash size in DIFI header (N*20h)

  020h 8   Level 4 block size (1 SHL N, usually 9=200h bytes)   ;/
  028h 8   Level 5 offset (usually 20h, aka level 1 end)        ;\SHA's for

  040h 8   Level 6 offset (usually 40h, aka level 2 end)        ;\SHA's for
  048h 8   Level 6 size   (usually 20h*N)                       ; Data
  050h 8   Level 6 block size (1 SHL N, usually 12=1000h bytes) ;/
  058h 8   Level 7 offset (unused for External IVFC Level 7)    ;\Data (eg.
  060h 8   Level 7 size   (usually 1000h*N)                     ; SAVE filesys)
  068h 8   Level 7 block size (1 SHL N, usually 12=1000h bytes) ;/
  070h 8   IVFC descriptor size? (usually 78h)
```

The above IVFC "size" values refer to "one half" (the 1st half is at "offset",
the 2nd half is at "offset+level3size").

## Loading active blocks


To read data from src\_offset (eg. begin of SAVE filesystem at src\_offset=0):

```
  load the active difi/ivfc/dpfs block
  if external_flag_from_DIFI[38h] then
    readbytes(partition_base+external_level7_base+src_offset, len)
  else
    level3_byte_addr = level7_base+src_offset
   snippet_loop:
    snippet_len = min(len, distance to level3_blocksize boundary)
    level2_bit_index = (level3_byte_addr/level3_blocksize) xor 1Fh    ;\
    level2_byte_addr = (level2_bit_index/8)                           ;
    level1_bit_index = (level2_byte_addr/level2_blocksize) xor 1Fh    ;
    level1_byte_addr = (level1_bit_index/8)                           ;/
    base1 = level1_base+level1_size*(active_flag_from_DIFI[039h])
    flag1 = readbyte(level1_byte_addr+base1, size=1)
    base2 = level2_base+level2_size*((flag1 shr (level1_bit_index AND 7) AND 1)
    flag2 = readbyte(level2_byte_addr+base2, size=1)
    base3 = level3_base+level3_size*((flag2 shr (level2_bit_index AND 7) AND 1)
    data  = readbytes(level3_byte_addr+base3, snippet_len)
    raise src/dst, decrease len by snippet_len, if len>0 then goto snippet_loop
```



## Partition


A partition can have two types of layout. This is determined by the field
DIFI+38h (Enable external IVFC level 7).

The layout type 0 (external IVFC level 7 disabled) contains

```
  DPFS Level 1         (contains active flags for DPFS level 2)
  DPFS Level 2         (contains active flags for DPFS level 3)
  DPFS Level 3         (contains IVFC levels and Data?)
    IVFC Level 4         (contains SHA256's for IVFC level 5)
    IVFC Level 5         (contains SHA256's for IVFC level 6)
    IVFC Level 6         (contains SHA256's for IVFC level 7)
    IVFC Level 7         (contains the actual content data)
```

The layout type 1 (external IVFC level 4 enabled) contains

```
  DPFS Level 1     ;Flags for DPFS Level 2
  DPFS Level 2     ;Flags for DPFS Level 3
  DPFS Level 3, and inside
    IVFC Level 4     ;SHA256's on IVFC Level 5
    IVFC Level 5     ;SHA256's on IVFC Level 6
    IVFC Level 6     ;SHA256's on IVFC Level 7
  IVFC Level 7 ;the actual content data, note that this is outside DPFS level 3
```

## AES CMAC


The AES CMAC is located at the beginning of the DISA / DIFF image, and it is
10h long. The rest F0h bytes before the header are unused.

The key used for the AES CMAC is generated by the hardware key engine.

The data being authenticated by the AES CMAC is a 20h-byte SHA-256 hash of a
data block.


## CTR-NOR0 This CMAC type is used for gamecard savegames, 28h-bytes

      - 000h 8    ID "CTR-NOR0"                             ;\CMAC area
      - 008h 20h  SHA-256 of the following 108h-byte block  ;/
      - 028h 8    ID "CTR-SAV0"
      - 030h 100h Copy of the DISA header

## CTR-SIGN This CMAC type is used for SD savegames, 30h-bytes

      - 000h 8    ID "CTR-SIGN"                             ;\
      - 008h 8    Title ID                                  ; CMAC area
      - 010h 20h  SHA-256 of the following 108h-byte block  ;/
      - 030h 8    ID "CTR-SAV0"
      - 038h 100h Copy of the DISA header

## CTR-SYS0 This CMAC type is used for NAND system save, 110h-bytes

      - 000h 8    ID "CTR-SYS0"
      - 008h 8    Save ID. The higher word is always zero
      - 010h 100h Copy of the DISA header

## CTR-EXT0 This CMAC type is used for extdata, 11Ch-bytes

      - 000h 8    ID "CTR-EXT0"
      - 008h 8    Extdata ID                eg. "00048000\x00000xx\" ?
      - 010h 4    0 for Quota.dat, 1 otherwise
      - 014h 4    ID in the "device" file name  "\00000000\nnnnnnnn" ?  ;\zero for
      - 018h 4    ID in the "device" directory name that the file is in ;/Quota.dat
      - 01Ch 100h Copy of the DIFF header

## CTR-9DB0 This CMAC type is used for title database, 10Ch-bytes

      - 000h 8    ID "CTR-9DB0"
      - 008h 4    Database .db file ID (0..5, see below)
      - 00Ch 100h Copy of the DIFF header
      - The Database .db file IDs are:
      - 0=ticket.db, 1=certs.db, 2=title.db, 3=import.db, 4=tmp\_t.db, 5=tmp\_i.db

Here is a summary table of the CMAC type and the AES key slot used:

```
  Usage           Media    Format  CMAC type       CMAC Keyslot
  Savegames       Gamecard DISA    CTR-NOR0        19h/33h
  Savegames       SD       DISA    CTR-SIGN        30h
  System SaveData NAND     DISA    CTR-SYS0        30h
  Private Extdata SD       DIFF    CTR-EXT0        30h
  Shared Extdata  NAND     DIFF    CTR-EXT0        30h
  Title Database  SD       DIFF    CTR-9DB0        30h
  Title Database  NAND     DIFF    CTR-9DB0        0Bh
```

Note: The AES keyslots are known (shown above), but the AES IV appears to be
unknown?



## IVFC tree


The IVFC tree is used for data verification. It is very similar to the IVFC
tree in RomFS, except that it has an additional level here. For level 4, 5 and
6, each level is a list of SHA-256 hash, of which each corresponds to a block
of the next level which is zero-padded to align the block size (the block size
of the next level is defined in the IVFC descriptor).


The partition master hash in the partition descriptor can be seen as IVFC level
0, which hashes level 4 following the same rule. The master hash is usually 20h
long, consisting only one hash. This is because most DISA / DIFF files are not
large enough to have multiple hashes on the top level, which isn't the case for
some title database files.


However, not all data is hashed - only ranges that have been written with valid
data are properly hashed.


Level 7 is the actual content of the partition, which is what the container
format essentially contains.



## IVFC Chain of trust


AES CMAC verifies the header.

The header verifies the active partition table via the table hash.

In the partition table, each descriptor verifies level 4 of its IVFC tree via
the master hash.

Each IVFC level verifies the next level, until the level 7, which is the inner
content (eg. the SAVE file system).




# <a name="3dsfilessavedatagamecardflashencryptionandwearleveling"></a>3DS Files - Savedata Gamecard FLASH Encryption and Wear Leveling



Unlike SD and NAND savegames, Gamecard savegames have and additional Encryption
and Wear Leveling layer.


```
 ________________________ Gamecard savegame Encryption ________________________
```



## Repeating CTR Fail (newbie guide on what is a repeating 512-byte keystream)


On the 3DS savegames are stored much like on the DS, that is on a FLASH chip in
the gamecart. On the DS these savegames were stored in plain-text but on the
3DS a layer of encryption was added. This is AES-CTR, as the contents of
several savegames exhibit the odd behavior that xor-ing certain parts of the
savegame together will result in the plain-text appearing.


The reason this works is because the stream cipher used has a period of 512
bytes. That is to say, it will repeat the same keystream after 512 bytes. The
way you encrypt with a stream cipher is you XOR your data with the keystream as
it is produced. Unfortunately, if your streamcipher repeats and you are
encrypting a known plain-text (in our case, zeros) you are basically giving
away your valuable keystream.



## Savegame keyY


All gamecard and (!!?!!) SD savegames are encrypted with AES-CTR. The base CTR
for gamecard savegames is all-zero. The gamecard savegame keyslots' keyY (these
savegame keyslots use the hardware key-generator) is unique for each region and
for each game. The NCSD partition flags determine the method used to generate
this keyY. When the save NCSD flags checked by the running NATIVE\_FIRM are
all-zero, the system will use the repeating CTR, otherwise a proper CTR which
never repeats within the image is used.


The AES-CMAC (which uses a hardware key-generator keyslot, as mentioned above)
at the beginning of the savegame must match the calculated CMAC using the
DISA/DIFF data, otherwise the savegame is considered corrupted (see below).


When all of the flags checked by the running NATIVE\_FIRM are clear, the keyY
(original keyY method used with saves where the CTR repeats within the image)
is the following:

```
  00h 8     First 8-bytes from the plaintext CXI accessdesc signature.
  08h 4     u32 CardID0 from gamecard plaintext-mode command 0x90,
              Process9 reads this with the NTRCARD hw. The actual cmdID used
              by Process9 is different since Process9 reads it with the
              gamecard in encrypted-mode.
  0Ch 4     u32 CardID1 from gamecard plaintext-mode command 0xA0,
              Process9 reads this with the NTRCARD hw. The actual cmdID used
              by Process9 is different since Process9 reads it with the
              gamecard in encrypted-mode.
```



## 2.0.0-2 Hashed keyY and 2.2.0-4 Savegame Encryption


When certain NCSD partition flags are set, a SHA-256 hash is calculated over
the data from the CXI (same data used with the original plain keyY), and the
0x40-bytes read from a gamecard command (this 0x40-byte data is also read by
GetRomId, which is the gamecard-uniqueID). The first 0x10-bytes from this hash
is used for the keyY. When flag[7] is set, the CTR will never repeat within the
save image, unlike the original CTR-method. All games which had the retail NCSD
image finalized after the 2.2.0-4 update (and contain 2.2.0-4+ in the System
update partition), use this encryption method.


This keyY generation method was implemented with 2.0.0-2 via NCSD partition
flag[3], however the proper CTR wasn't implemented for flag[7] until 2.2.0-4.
The hashed keyY flag[3] implemented with 2.0.0-2 was likely never used with
retail gamecards.



## 6.0.0-11 Savegame keyY


```
  XXX also used/similar for NCCH "Keyslot25h" ???
```

6.0.0-11 implemented support for generating the savegame keyY with a new
method, this method is much more complex than previous keyY methods. This is
enabled via new NCSD partition flags, all retail games which have the NCSD
image finalized after the 6.0.0-11 release (and 6.0.0-11+ in the system update
partition) will have these flags set for using this new method.


A SHA-256 hash is calculated over the same data used with the above hashed keyY
method, after hashing the above data the following data is hashed: the CXI
programID, and the ExeFS:/.code hash from the decrypted ExeFS header. An
AES-CMAC (the keyslot used for this uses the hardware key-scrambler) is then
calculated over this hash, the output CMAC is used for the savegame keyY.


The keyY used for calculating this AES-CMAC is initialized while NATIVE\_FIRM is
loading, this keyY is generated via the RSA engine. The RSA slot used here is
slot0 (key-data for slot0 is initialized by bootrom), this RSA slot0 key-data
is overwritten during system boot. This RSA slot0 key-data gets overwritten
with the RSA key-data used for verifying RSA signatures, every time Process9
verifies any RSA signatures except for NCCH accessdesc signatures. Starting
with 7.0.0-13 this key-init function used at boot is also used to initialize a
separate keyslot used for the new NCCH encryption method.


This Process9 key-init function first checks if a certain 0x10-byte block in
the 0x01FF8000 region is all-zero. When all-zero it immediately returns,
otherwise it clears that block then continues to do the key generation. This is
likely for supporting launching a v6.0+ NATIVE\_FIRM under this FIRM.


```
 ___________________________ Gamecard wear leveling ___________________________
```


The 3DS employs a wear leveling scheme on the savegame FLASH chips (only used
for CARD1 gamecards). This is done through the usage of blockmaps and a
journal. The blockmap is located at offset 0 of the flash chip, and is
immediately followed by the journal. The initial state is dictated by the
blockmap, and the journal is then applied to that.


First, there are 8 bytes whose purposes are currently unknown. Then comes the
actual blockmap. The blockmap structure is simple:

```
  struct header_entry {
    uint8_t phys_sec  ;when bit7=1: block has chksums (else chksums are all 0)
    uint8_t alloc_cnt
    uint8_t chksums[8]
  } __attribute__((__packed__));
```

There's one entry per sector, counting from physical sector 1 (sector 0
contains the blockmap/journal).

The 2 bytes that follow the blockmap are the CRC16 (with initial value FFFFh)
of the first 8 bytes and the blockmap.


Then comes the journal. The journal structure is as follows:

```
  struct sector_entry {
    uint8_t virt_sec         ;Mapped to sector
    uint8_t prev_virt_sec    ;Physical sector previously mapped to
    uint8_t phys_sec         ;Mapped from sector
    uint8_t prev_phys_sec    ;Virtual sector previously mapped to
    uint8_t phys_realloc_cnt ;Amount of times physical sector has been remapped
    uint8_t virt_realloc_cnt ;Amount of times virtual sector has been remapped
    uint8_t chksums[8]
  } __attribute__((__packed__));
```


```
  struct long_sector_entry{
    struct sector_entry sector
    struct sector_entry dupe
    uint32_t magic           ;With magic being a constant 080D6CE0h.
  }__attribute__((__packed__));
```


The checksums in the blockmap/journal entries work as follows:

each byte is the checksum of an encrypted 200h bytes large block,

to calculate the checksum, a CRC16 of the block (with initial value FFFFh) is
calculated, and the two bytes of the CRC16 are XORed together to produce the
8bit checksum

  ...  ..    Strings (usually in UTF-16, terminated by 0000h)
  ..   ..    Padding to 16-byte boundary (ABh-filled)
```

UTF-16 Characters:

```
  0000h=End of String (except inside Escape sequences)
  000Ah=Linebreak
  000Eh=Escape Code (change text color, etc.)
  00xxh=ASCII Characters 20h..7Eh
```

Escape Sequences:

```
  000h 2     Escape Code (000Eh)
  002h 2     Command Type
  004h 2     Command SubType
  006h 2     Number of following parameter bytes (0=None) (usually even)
  008h N     Parameters
```

Command Type.SubType are maybe somewhat like so:

```
  0000h.0003h Change Color maybe (param16bit) ?
  0000h.000xh Change other stuff maybe, like font size?
```

There is probably also something for inserting User Name or other strings and
numeric variables, sound effects, and perhaps something for prompting user
input?



## TSY1 Chunk (Style Info)


```
  000h 4     Chunk ID "TSY1"
  004h 4     Chunk Size (minus 10h, and excluding 16-byte padding) (NumMsg*4)

  010h N*4   Style index in MSBP file (aka MsgPrjBn) (FFFFFFFFh=None?)
  ..   ..    Padding to 16-byte boundary (ABh-filled)
```

Uh, 3DS System Settings has Style Index values 0, 1, 2, and FFFFFFFFh (but
doesn't has a .msbt file at all).



## NLI1 Chunk (reportedly used in some files, instead of LBL1/ATR1/TSY1?)


```
  0x00h 4        Chunk ID "NLI1"
  0x04h 4        Chunk Size (minus 10h, and excluding 16-byte padding)
  0x08h 8        Zero
  0x10h 4        Number of entries
  0x14h N*(4+4)  Whatever List (Message ID? and Offset in TXT2)
```


Hash Tables

Many items (such as messages in msbt files or colors in msbp files) are looked
up by label. The labels are looked up with a hash table and are stored in a
different block than the items themselves. In official files the hash table
always has a fixed number of slots (101 in msbt files, 29 in msbp files), even
if it contains only a few labels.

```
  The following hash algorithm is used:
  def calc_hash(label, num_slots):
    hash = 0
    for char in label:
        hash = hash * 492h + ord(char)
    return (hash AND 0FFFFFFFFh) MOD num_slots
```

The block with the labels contains the following data:

```
  000h 4       Number of slots
  004h 8*N     Hash table slots
  ...  ..      Labels
```

Hash Table Slot

```
  000h 4       Number of labels

```

Label

```
  000h 1       Length of label string
  001h ..      Label string (without null terminator)
  ...  4       Item index

  8     Application usage is to be recorded. If this is zero, it causes
          the application's usage to be omitted from the Home Menu's icon
          cache, as well as in other places.
  9     unknown/unspecified
  10    Disables SD Savedata Backups for this title. This is in addition to
         the blacklist.
  11    unknown/unspecified
  12    New 3DS exclusive title. Shows an error if used on Old 3DS.
  13-31 unknown/unspecified
```


Age Rating: Active ratings have a bitmask of 80h, and inactive ratings have no
bitmask at all. Ratings without the 80h bitmask are ignored. 40h bitmask
indicates Rating Pending. 20h bitmask indicates No Age Restriction. Age limits
are set by adding the minimal age to 80h (for example, limiting to 12 years and
up would give a bitmask of 8Ch)


Region Lockout: Regions are 'included' in region lock by setting their bitmask
value. Nintendo defines region free as 7FFFFFFFh. Early in the 3DS'
development, Nintendo grouped the Australian and Europe markets together.
Nintendo defines market Europe as having the combined bitmasks of Europe and
Australia. No 3DS' which check the Australia bitmask have been seen (Australia
uses the European 3DS model).


The EULA version is checked when the Accept EULA flag is set, the version is
compared to one stored in the 3DS. If the SMDH version is greater, then the
user will be prompted to accept the EULA.



## Effect of SaveData and AutoSave


These options have no effect on the performance of the application itself:
they're used to select an appropriate warning when closing an application from
Home.

Both off: "Closing software" (no warning if quitting directly with X)

SaveData: "Do you want to close [...]? (Unsaved data will be lost.)"

AutoSave: ?

Both on: "Saving data and closing software..." (no warning if quitting directly
with X)



## 'Optimal Animation Default Frame' (for BNR)


This is a float, indicating the preferred (or 'most representative') frame for
the banner animation.



## CEC (StreetPass) ID


This u32 represents the application CEC ID. This is likely loaded by
applications for use with the CEC services as well.



## Icon graphics


Both of the icons are encoded in RGB565 meaning 16bpp.

The data is encoded in tiles (starting from size 8x8, continuing recursively).

- If the buffer is like this:
  - 0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7       8       9
  - 10      11      12      13      14      15      16
- Then the image would look like this:
  - x=0     x=1     x=2     x=3     x=4
  - 0       1       4       5       16
  - 2       3       6       7       ...
  - 8       9       12      13
  - 10      11      14      15
- Uh, are that pixels or 8x8pix tiles?
- Either way, how would that translate to actual 24x24pix or 48x48pix icons??

Although both icons are known to be RGB565, developers have the option of
encoding icons (and banners) with the following encodings:

```
  RGBA8
  RGB8
  RGBA5551
  RGB565     (used)
  RGBA4
  LA8
  HILO8
  L8
  A8
  LA4
  L4
  ETC1
  ETC1A4
```

This does not necessarily mean the other encodings will be used, it is just
that those are the options when compiling. Like we've seen with Super Mario 3D
Land Nintendo has changed save file encryption, and "likewise" they can encode
icons and banners differently should they choose to. Currently we've seen just
RGB565 so don't be fooled if an icon doesn't show up right! It is probably one
of these formats above. Although we will probably not see other formats used
for a while it's nice to know they have an opportunity to change.

Also note that it seems Nintendo stores "each pixel in word-order", so the
actual "order of order" of "each color channel" in memory will depend on the
endianness. uh, what?

# <a name="3dsfilesvideobannercbmd"></a>3DS Files - Video Banner (CBMD)



CBMD - CTR Banner Model Data (archive for CGFX/CWAV files)

These are stored in CXI ExeFS:/banner and optionally in extdata exbanner.

This is used for banners of titles you see in the home menu.

BNR used for the app banners in the CXI/exbanner is the same as CBMD with CWAV
at the end (uh, who is "BNR", and is that CWAV always supported in all cases,
or only for that "BNR" thing?).



## CBMD Header

```


"The common CGFX is used if the CGFX offset for the system region/language is
zero. Those optional offsets can be used in extdata exbanner, but separate CBMD
banner files for each region/language can be used as well."



## Entry Size


The header contains only offsets. To compute the size, search the next bigger
offset (or use the filesize as max offset), and then subtract the current
offset from that value. Note: The list does usually contain increasing offsets
(but it may be a bad idea to rely on that, eg. EUR-Spanish and USA-Spanish
might use the same offsets).



## CGFX Graphics


- [3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX)](#3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfx)
Banner CGFX files are LZ11-compressed, the decompressed CGFX size shouldn't
exceed 80000h bytes for banners.



## CWAV Sound


- [3DS Files - Sound Wave Data (CWAV Format)](#3dsfilessoundwavedatacwavformat)
Banner CWAV total channels must be 2, and the length of the audio must be 3
seconds or less (uh, is that regardless of sample rate/sample size?), otherwise
the sound will play incorrectly (beeping/clicking) or the model may fail to
load.




# <a name="3dsfilesvideobannerextendedbanner"></a>3DS Files - Video Banner (Extended Banner)




## Overview


The Extended Banner is used to add text (and optionally an extra texture) to a
given banner. It can also (optionally) be used to set an expiration date for a
banner.


See "\user\ExBanner\" for how the extended-banners are loaded from extdata. The
Home Menu extended-banner loading function will immediately return without
loading anything if the programID is for System Settings.



## System titles using extended banners


```
  Mii Maker
  Face Raiders
```



## Format - Extension: .BIN (...stored somewhere as extdata on SD card?)

The date used for never-expiring exbanners varies, on retail like with Mii
Maker this is 31 Dec 2099 (year=833h, month=0Ch, day=1Fh). The
expiration-timestamp is only used for SpotPass exbanners, not
extdata-exbanners.



## Texture Colour Formats


```
  00h = RGBA8
  01h = RGB8
  02h = RGBA5551
  03h = RGBA565
  04h = RGBA4
  05h = LA8
  06h = HILO8
  07h = L8
  08h = A8
  09h = LA4
  0Ah = L4
  0Bh = A4
  0Ch = ETC1
  0Dh = ETC1A4
```



## SpotPass


When Home Menu loads extended-banners, it also attempts to load a "CBMD" banner
via SpotPass service commands. Normally this CBMD banner doesn't exist in
extended-banner extdata. This is broken with New3DS titles since Home Menu uses
these BOSS commands with the New3DS bitmask in the programID set. The common
and language-specific (when offset is non-zero) "CGFX" specified by the CBMD
are decompressed and processed.


The "CGFX" sections in this CBMD are actually the exact same exbanners loaded
from normal extdata. The exbanner data from SpotPass is stored to the same
state as the extdata-exbanners. No CWAV is loaded from SpotPass data.


The exbanners from SpotPass must have a timestamp less than current\_datetime,
otherwise they won't be parsed. The timestamp for the banner is calculated
with: nintimestamp\_mktime(out, exbanner->year, exbanner->month,
exbanner->day, \<hour=23>, \<minute = 59>, \<second = 59>,
\<millisecond = 999>);

# <a name="3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfx"></a>3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX)



CGFX files exist as standalone files, and can be also found in CBMD banner
archives, usually with LZ11 compression.

CGFX is a container format used to store graphics resources.



## Overall CGFX Format


- [3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX Header, Blocks, DICTs)](#3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfxheaderblocksdicts)

- [3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_0Eh,0Fh - PEMT Emitters/Particles)](#3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfx0eh0fhpemtemittersparticles)


## Unknown CGFX Sections


These do reportedly exist... somewhere? Unknown which files do actually have
such sections.

- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_03h - ???? Materials)

- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_07h - CFOG? Fogs)

- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_0Bh - ???? Visibility animations)

- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_0Ch - ???? Camera animations)

The Materials are all-unknown. The Fogs are reportedly called CFOG, but
anything else is unknown. The two animation types might use CANM format like
the other three animation types, but that's just guessed.



## Skeleton data (uh, what? where?)


Each entry is E0h bytes in length and organized this way:

```
  00h 4     Offset (self relative) to name symbol
  04h 4     ?
  08h 4     Joint ID
  0Ch 4     Parent joint ID
  10h 4     Signed offset (self-relative) to parent joint
  14h 18h   unknown/unspecified
  2Ch 0Ch   Angle vector (floats, x, y, z)
  38h 0Ch   Position vector (floats, x, y, z)
  44h 30h   Transformation matrix (4x3)
  74h 30h   Identity matrix ? (4x3)
  A4h 1Ch   unknown/unspecified
```

Each entry stores the joint transformation data twice; once as angle/position
vectors and once as a transformation matrix. Each entry also stores a second
matrix which appears to always be identity(?)

# <a name="3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfxheaderblocksdicts"></a>3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX Header, Blocks, DICTs)




## CGFX Header


```
  000h 4     ID "CGFX"
  004h 2     Byte Order (FEFFh)
  006h 2     CGFX header size (14h)
  008h 4     Revision (can be 05000000h) (or 01000000h=Old, incompatible)
  00Ch 4     Total Filesize (bytes)
  010h 4     Number of blocks (usually 1=DATA, or 2=DATA+IMAG)
  ...  ..    DATA Block (DICT's, CMDL/TXOB/etc., and DICT Symbols)
  ...  ..    IMAG Block (optional, eg. for TXOB bitmaps)
```

The DATA block contains various small data structures. It's more or less
required to load the whole DATA block to memory when parsing those structs.

The IMAG block isn't required in memory (or, when needed, one may want to store
its content directly in VRAM).



## DATA Block (for CGFX Version 05000000h)


```
  000h      4     ID "DATA"
  004h      4     DATA Block Size (including DICT,CMDL,etc.)
  008h      4+4   DICT 00h for CMDL  Models                (NumEntries, Offset)
  010h      4+4   DICT 01h for TXOB  Textures              (NumEntries, Offset)
  018h      4+4   DICT 02h for LUTS  Look-up tables?       (NumEntries, Offset)
  020h      4+4   DICT 03h for ?     Materials             (NumEntries, Offset)
  028h      4+4   DICT 04h for SHDR  Shaders (+DVLB)       (NumEntries, Offset)
  030h      4+4   DICT 05h for CCAM  Cameras               (NumEntries, Offset)
  038h      4+4   DICT 06h for CFLT/CHLT/CALT Lights       (NumEntries, Offset)
  040h      4+4   DICT 07h for CFOG? Fogs                  (NumEntries, Offset)
  048h      4+4   DICT 08h for CENV  Environments          (NumEntries, Offset)
  050h      4+4   DICT 09h for CANM  Skeleton animations   (NumEntries, Offset)
  058h      4+4   DICT 0Ah for CANM  Texture animations    (NumEntries, Offset)
  060h      4+4   DICT 0Bh for ?     Visibility animations (NumEntries, Offset)
  068h      4+4   DICT 0Ch for ?     Camera animations     (NumEntries, Offset)
  070h      4+4   DICT 0Dh for CANM  Light animations      (NumEntries, Offset)
  078h      4+4   DICT 0Eh for PEMT  Emitters              (NumEntries, Offset)
 Below entry doesn't exist in all files (ie. abort here if [80h]="DICT").
 (080h)     4+4   DICT 0Fh for PEMT  Particles             (NumEntries, Offset)
  ...       ..    DICT's and CMDL/TXOB/etc. and Symbols...
```

The above Offsets are self-relative pointers to the corresponding DICT.

Unused DICTs have NumEntries=0 and Offset=0 (ie. the Offset doesn't point
anywhere in that case).



## IMAG Block (if present)


```
  000h       4     ID "IMAG"
  004h       4     IMAG Block Size
  008h       ...   Data (eg. texture bitmaps, referenced from TXOB's)
```



## DATA Block (for CGFX Version 01000000h)


3DS Activity Log does have some old CGFX file in RomFS:\simple.bcmdl, its the
data block lacks the "DATA" ID and Block Size, and the DICT's merely have
Offsets (without NumEntries).

```
  000h      4*9   DICT's (nine Offsets)
```

The CMDL/MTOB/etc. blocks in that file are probably also incompatible with
newer CGFX files?



## DICT - Directory with Symbol/Offset for each file


```
  000h 4     ID "DICT"
  004h 4     DICT size (1Ch+N*10h)
  008h 4     Number of entries (same as NumEntries in DATA's DICT list)
  00Ch 10h   DICT entry 0    (Patricia Tree Root entry)
  01Ch 10h*N DICT entry 1..N (Patricia Tree and actual Symbols/Offsets)
```

Patricia Tree Root entry:

```
  000h 4     Patricia Tree First Bit-number (always FFFFFFFFh=dummy/last)
  002h 2     Patricia Tree First entry (1..N) (usually points to rightmost bit)
  004h 0Ah   Patricia Tree Unused (zerofilled)
```

DICT entry 1..N format:

```
  000h 4     Patricia Tree Bit-number to be tested (0=Bit0 of 1st char) ?
  004h 2     Patricia Tree Next entry when test=0 ?
  006h 2     Patricia Tree Next entry when test=1 ?
  008h 4     Offset to symbol (self-relative) --> ASCII name
  00Ch 4     Offset to object (self-relative) --> flags followed by "CMDL" etc?
```

The Patricia Tree is intended for searching Symbols by testing a few bits
(without comparing all characters). The tree does somewhat unforunately start
with the highest bit in rightmost character (so the search string must be
assumed to be zeropadded). Unknown when the final entry is reached... when the
bit-test number is same/bigger than previous bit-test?


Note on DICT names: There can be several root entries with same name (eg. 3DS
Download Play ExeFS:\banner has name "COMMON" used for CFGX\_00h and CFGX\_09h
and CFGX\_0Ah root entries).




# <a name="3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfx00hcmdlmodels"></a>3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_00h - CMDL Models)

A CMDL section refers to outside data; it can not be considered separately from
the rest of the CGFX file. The second DICT in the CMDL section contains offsets
to MTOB objects.



## SOBJ List, at CMDL([B8h]+B8h)


```

## MTOB - Materials - some kind of Texture Info, linked to TXOB

## SOBJ


SOBJ structures can be used to describe 3D objects that are part of the model.
If such is the case then they will follow this structure:

```
  000h 4     Flags (bit4: model, bit1: skeleton)
  004h 4     ID "SOBJ"
  008h 4     ?
  00Ch 4     Unknown symbol offset (self-relative)
  010h 0Ch   ?
  01Ch 4     Offset (self-relative) to Unknown1 (array of floats?)
  020h 0Ch   Mesh position vector (X/Y/Z floats)
  02Ch 4+4   Face Group List    (NumEntries, Offset) (list contains offsets)
  034h 4     ?
  038h 4+4   Vertex Group List  (NumEntries, Offset) (list contains offsets)
  040h 4     Unknown offset (self-relative) ?
```


Face groups:

```
  000h 4+4   Bone Group ID List (NumEntries, Offset) (list contains 32bit IDs)
  008h 4     ?
  00Ch 4+4   Unknown2 List      (NumEntries, Offset) (list contains offsets)
```


Unknown2:

```
  000h 4+4   Face Group Descriptor List (NumEntries, Offset) (contains offsets)
  008h 4+4   Unknown3 List              (NumEntries, Offset) (contains 32bit's)
  010h 8     ?
```


Face array descriptor:

```
  000h 4     Flags (bit 1: vertex index format: 0=byte, 1=short)
  004h 4     ?
  008h 4+4   Vertex Index Array (SizeInBytes, Offset)
```


Vertex groups come in a number of different formats. Typically the first vertex
group entry is of format 40000002h and contains the actual vertex array.


Vertex group format 40000002h:

```
  000h 4     Flags (40000002h)
  004h 4     ?
  008h 4     ?
  00Ch 4     ?
  010h 4     ?
  014h 4+4   Vertex Array       (SizeInBytes, Offset)
  01Ch 4     ?
  020h 4     ?
  024h 4     Vertex stride/size in bytes (see below)
  028h 4     Unknown3 count
  02Ch 4     Offset (self-relative) to component declaration offset array
```


Each mesh's primary vertex group contains an array of vertex component
declaration objects, defining the order and parameters for each of a vertex's
components.


Vertex component declaration:

```
  000h 4     Flags (40000001h)
  004h 4     Vertex component type (see below)
  008h 4     ?
  00Ch 4     ?
  010h 4     ?
  014h 4     ?
  018h 4     ?
  01Ch 4     ?
  020h 4     ?
  024h 1     Vertex component data type (see below)
  025h 1     ?
  026h 1     ?
  027h 1     ?
  028h 4     Number of values in this component (eg. XYZ=3, UV=2)
  02Ch 4     Multiplier for this component's values (float)
  030h 4     Position of this component within vertex stride
```

Vertex formats with bone data support multiple bone assignment. In this case,
the sum of all bone weights is 64h.

- Vertex component types:
  - 00h=Position
  - 01h=Normal
  - 02h=? (unobserved)
  - 03h=Color
  - 04h=UV0
  - 05h=UV1
  - 06h=? (unobserved, possibly UV2)
  - 07h=Weight
  - 08h=Index
- Vertex component data types:
  - 00h=sbyte
  - 01h=byte
  - 02h=short
  - 03h=? (unobserved, possibly ushort)
  - 04h=? (unobserved, possibly int)
  - 05h=? (unobserved, possibly uint)
  - 06h=float

Vertex components are stored as one of the above data types, and the vertex
component declaration contains a multiplier that adapts the values to the float
version which the game will use. For example, color RGBA values are stored as
bytes, and the multiplier converts them from 0-255 to 0-1.0, and position
components using short values are normalized via the multiplier to take
advantage of the entire short value range.

TXOB is found in most CGFX files.



## TXOB - Texture Objects?


TXOBs are contained within MTOBs. They can describe textures; if such is the
case, then their structure is as follows:

- Can be 40h-byte or 5Ch-byte size?
- 3dbrew messed blurb claims 4Ch-bytes (with overlapping entries)?
- Or are the 40h-byte ones sub-items in MTOB?
- And only the 5Ch-byte ones are actually DICT 01h entries?
  - 000h 4     Flags (eg. 20000004h=40h-byte, or 20000011h=5Ch-byte)

  - 008h 4     Revision? (05000000h)

  - 014h 4     Unknown (0)
  - 018h 4     Texture height (eg. 40h)
  - 01Ch 4     Texture width  (eg. 10h)
  - 020h 4     Unknown (?)    (eg. 6758h, 6756h, 6758h)  ;\flags maybe?
  - 024h 4     Unknown (?)    (eg. 6760h, 6761h, 1401h)  ;/or handle/ID/index?
  - 028h 4     Mipmap levels  (eg. 1)
  - 02Ch 4     Unknown (0)
  - 030h 4     Unknown (0)
  - 034h 4     Texture format (eg. 5) (see below)
  - 038h 4     Unknown (?)    (eg. 4)
  - 03Ch 4     Texture height (eg. 40h)  ;\same as in [18h,1Ch] ?
  - 040h 4     Texture width  (eg. 10h)  ;/
  - 044h 4     Texture data size (eg. 800h) (width\*height\*bytes\_per\_pixel)
  - 048h 4     Texture data offset (self-relative) (eg. 1A070h) (that's in IMAG)
  - 04Ch 4     Unknown (0)
  - 050h 4     Unknown (?)       (eg. 10h)
  - 054h 4     Unknown (0)
  - 058h 4?    Unknown (0)

Texture format:

```
  00h=RGBA8
  01h=RGB8
  02h=RGBA5551
  03h=RGB565
  04h=RGBA4
  05h=LA8
  06h=HILO8
  07h=L8
  08h=A8
  09h=LA4
  0Ah=L4
  0Bh=A4 ?
  0Ch=ETC1 (see notes below)
  0Dh=ETC1A4 ?
```

Every texture format has its texture data divided into 8x8 tiles. See SMDH for
more information. ETC1 is a compressed texture format which compresses blocks
of 4x4 pixels into u64s. These u64 are traditionally stored in big endian;
however, nintendo's implementation stores them in little endian. ETC1 textures
are stored in 8x8 tiles; decompressed 4x4 therefore have to be organized
accordingly. See [1] for implementation example.

CANM skeleton is found in some CGFX files, 3DS System Settings ExeFS:\banner

CANM texture is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Download Play ExeFS:\banner

CANM light is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Camera RomFS:\res\P\_Finder\_U


All of those types do begin with ID "CANM", but unknown if they are actually
using the same data structure(s).



## CANM (for Skeleton Animations, and Texture Animations)


```
  N/A  -     There is no leading Flags entry,
  000h 4     ID "CANM"
  004h 4     Revision (05000000h)
  008h 4     Name Offset (self-relative) eg. COMMON (same as in parent DICT)
  00Ch 4     Name Offset (self-relative) eg. SkeletalAnimation
  010h 4     Unknown (1)
  014h 4     Unknown (44160000h) (float32 maybe?)
  018h 4+4   DICT for ... whatever (NumEntries,Offset)  (Offset=0Ch)
  020h 4+4   Unknown (0,0)
```

Note: In the above example, the name "COMMON" is used for both CFGX\_00h and
CFGX\_09h and CFGX\_0Ah root entries.

The DICT in the CANM block(s) can contain items with various names, the
format(s) of that items are unknown.




# <a name="3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfx0eh0fhpemtemittersparticles"></a>3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_0Eh,0Fh - PEMT Emitters/Particles)



- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_0Eh - PEMT Emitters)

- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX\_0Fh - PEMT Particles)

PEMT emitters is found in some CGFX files, eg. Mii Maker RomFS:\effects\..

PEMT particles is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Camera RomFS:\effect\P.pack



## PEMT Format (as for CGFX\_0Fh Particles) (unknown if CGFX\_0Eh is same/similar)


```
  000h 4     Flags (eg. 40000006h)
  004h 4     ID "PEMT"
  008h 4     Revision (05000000h)
  00Ch 4     Name Offset (self-relative) (same as in parent DICT)
  010h 4+4   Unknown (0,0)
  018h 4+4   Unknown (1,1)
  020h ...   Several zeroes and float32's ...?
  0B8h 4     Name Offset (self-relative) (whatever name?)
  0BCh 4     Unknown (24h)                      (Offset?)
  0C0h 4     Unknown (0)
  0C4h 4     Unknown (3F800000h) (or 40000000h) (float32?)
  0C8h 4     Unknown (0)         (or 3DCCCCCDh)
  0CCh 4     Unknown (0Ah)       (or 13Dh)
  0D0h 4     Unknown (0)         (or 0)
  0D4h 4     Unknown (1)         (or 0)
  0D8h 4     Unknown (168h)      (or 3)
  0DCh 4     Unknown (0)         (or 4)
```

Then there comes some more stuff at offset 0E0h (which might be addressed via
Offset 24h stored at [0BCh] in above structure?). That extra data can somehow
vary randomly with/without DICT at different locations (it seems to be related
on "Flags" in first which can be 04000000h, 10000000h, 20000000h, 40000000h,
80000000h, although there are two variants for Flags=20000000h).

Unknown how that makes sense... maybe some of the below stuff is totally
unrelated to PEMT (ie. it might be referenced from somewhere else, and just
happens to be located after PEMT).


3DS Camera RomFS:\effect\P.pack\ScoreE.bcptlLZ has three variants with DICT
(all in one file).



## Variant with DICT and Flags=20000000h


```
  000h 4     Flags? (20000000h)

```


## Variant with DICT and Flags=10000000h


```
  000h 4     Flags? (10000000h)
  004h 4     Unknown (0)                                ;\no floats here
  008h 4     Unknown (80000000h)                        ; (or only a few)
  00Ch 4     Unknown (0)                                ;/
  010h 4     Name Offset (self-relative) (whatever name?)
  014h 4     Unknown (3)
  018h 4+4   DICT for ... whatever (NumEntries,Offset)
  020h 4+4   Unknown (1,8)                    (Num,Offset?)  ----.
  028h 4     Unknown (0)                                         |
  02Ch ..    Unknown (0)                                   <-----'
```

Then comes the DICT (unless type is 04000000h)... the DICT is containing
whatever... it can have MANY entries, in unknown format(s).



## Variant without DICT and Flags=04000000h


As found in Mii Maker RomFS:\effect\..\QR00.bcptl

```
  000h 4     Unknown (04000000h)
  004h 4     Unknown (0)             ;has only some floats, no DICT...
  008h 1Ch   Floats and/or whatever
  024h 2     Uhm, two zero bytes? (then followed by Symbol table)
```



## Variant without DICT and Flags=20000000h (despite same Flags can have DICT)


And Mii Maker also has some file with yet smaller DICT-less block, but with
20000000h (which usuallly DOES have DICT, but not in this case).

```
  000h 4     Unknown (20000000h)
  004h 4     Unknown (0)             ;has only some floats, no DICT...
  008h 18h   Floats and/or whatever
  020h 2     Uhm, bytes 00h, 01h? (then followed by Symbol table)
```



## Variant without DICT and Flags=80000000h


And, AR Games RomFS:\i\_ar\effect\Ef\_drawing.lz77

```
  000h 4     Unknown (80000000h)
  004h 4     Unknown (0)             ;has only some floats, no DICT...
  008h 10h   Floats and/or whatever
  018h 4     Unknown (0)
```


Some of the DICT-less variants seem to contain two bytes (rather than a whole
32bit word) in last entry? Usually that's padded to 32bit alignment, but not in
the last entry (which occurs right before the string table, which can start at
a non-aligned location).




# <a name="3dsfilesvideoshadersdvlbanddvobformat"></a>3DS Files - Video Shaders (DVLB and DVOB Format)



There are two shader file formats:

```
  DVLB - Vertex Shader Library (can contain one or more shaders) (common/used)
  DVOB - Vertex Shader Object  (single shader) (unknown if/where that's used?)
```

Shaders are usually stored in folder RomFS:\shaders, with extensions

```
  .shbin  Shader Binary in DVLB format (most common)
  .??     Shader Binary in DVOB format (unknown if/where that's used?)
  .bcsdr  Shader Binary in DVLB format stored inside of a CGFX container
  .csdr   ASCII, with shader binary(ies?) encoded in BASE64  (eg. in AR Games)
```



## DVLB Format (Vertex Shader Library) (can contain one or more shaders)


```

  004h 4    N = number of DVLEs in SHBIN
  008h 4*N  DVLE offset table (offsets to start of the DVLB(???) sections)
```

There is one DVLP block, containing the binary opcode/opdesc data for all
shaders (located right after the above header, ie. at offset 008h+4\*N).

  Symbols in DVLP chunk:    Source Filenames
  Symbols in DVLE chunk(s): Labels and Names for Input registers
```

DVOB files have all those symbols in a single Symbol Table.




# <a name="3dsfilesvideofontscfntandffntformat"></a>3DS Files - Video Fonts (CFNT and FFNT Format)




## CTR Font Format


.bcfnt files are bitmap fonts made for the 3ds. The system font uses this
format too except the header is changed from CFNT to CFNU and all file offsets
are changed to absolute in memory offsets.

```
  CFNT - 3DS Font version 3 file
  CFNU - 3DS Font version 3 stored in memory (System Font)
  FFNT - 3DS Font version 4 file
```

The format is based on the Nitro Font format for DS/DSi:

- [DS Cartridge Nitro Font Resource Format](ds.html#dscartridgenitrofontresourceformat)


## CFNT Header


```
  000h 4   ID ("CFNT" or "CFNU" or "FFNT")

## Truetype Fonts (TTF)


Some 3DS titles are alsu using Truetype fonts:

```
  3DS System Data Archives 1, web-kit/OSS CROs (RomFS:\font\nintendo.ttf)
  3DS Browser applet (RomFS:\browser\font\nintendo_NTLG-DB_001.ttf)
```

That fileformat is also used in the Windows operating system:

```
  used in Windows 3.1 (Windows\System\*.ttf)
  used in Windows 95 (Windows\Fonts\*.ttf)
```

# <a name="3dsfilesvideotexturepackagectpk"></a>3DS Files - Video Texture Package (CTPK)



CTPK archives can contain one or more texture files. The archive does usually
contain filenames with .tga extension (although the bitmaps are raw data,
unrelated to the Targa .tga format).


CTPK is used in "3DS AR Games" (RomFS:\i\_ar\tex\Tx\_fishing.ctpk), and
reportedly in 3DS games "Persona Q" and "Persona Q2". Anyways, more common 3DS
texture formats seem to be CLIM files, and TXOB's inside of CFGX files.



## CTPK Header


```
  000h 4     ID "CTPK"                                              ;\

# <a name="3dsfilesbase64encoding"></a>3DS Files - BASE64 Encoding



BASE64 is used to encode binary data into 7bit ASCII characters (with 6 bits
per char, aka 3 bytes per 4 chars), eg. for binary attachments in email
messages. The 3DS uses BASE64 in .CSDR shader files, and in 3DS Browser applet
.PEM files.



## BASE64 Character --> Binary


```
  "A..Z" --> value 00..25 (00h..19h)
  "a..z" --> value 26..51 (1Ah..33h)
  "0..9" --> value 52..61 (34h..3Dh)
  "+"    --> value 62     (3Eh)
  "/"    --> value 63     (3Fh)
  "="    --> padding to 4-character boundary (if needed, at end of file)
  CR,LF  --> ignored
```



## 3DS .CSDR Shader files


Found in 3DS Nintendo Zone, 3DS AR Games, 3DS Face Raiders
(RomFS:\shaders\\*.csdr).

```
  <NintendoWareIntermediateFile>
    <GraphicsContentCtr Namespace="" Version="0.7.0">

        </ShaderCtr>
      </Shaders>
    </GraphicsContentCtr>
  </NintendoWareIntermediateFile>
```

The .CSDR files uses 0Dh,0Ah for linebreaks, and 09h TAB's to indent lines. The
binary data is stored in a single long line without linebreaks, terminated
"\<". The decoded BASE64 data contains a standard "DVLB" 3DS shader file.

- [3DS Files - Video Shaders (DVLB and DVOB Format)](#3dsfilesvideoshadersdvlbanddvobformat)
Unknown if the \<Descriptions> or other fields are containing any useful
additional data. Unknown if a .CSDR file can contain more than one "DVLB"
binary.

# <a name="3dsfilesvideo3dphotosmpo"></a>3DS Files - Video 3D Photos (MPO)



The Multi-Picture Object (MPO) format developed by CIPA allows to store
multiple images in one file, the 3DS (and other stereoscopic cameras) are using
it to store 3D photos (ie. two images, from two different perspectives; that
is, basically two JPEGs badged together, with Exif or JFIF headers in each
JPEG, and with an additional MPO header in the first JPEG). The official MPO
specs can be found here:

```
  <a href="http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DC-X007_E.pdf"><font color="#808080">http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DC-X007_E.pdf</font></a>

```

The 3DS Camera files are using MPOs with Exif headers, including some Nintendo
specific information in the Exif header.

There also some other MPOs found in 3DS titles (eg. 3DS Nintendo Zone has a MPO
with JFIF header, and without Nintendo specific Exif data in
RomFS:\www\included\_html\boss\_page\BOSS\_JP\shared\_images\top\_screen.mpo or 3DS
Camera has non-Nintendo Exif header in RomFS:\depug\_mpo\_\resizable.mpo).

# <a name="3dsfilessoundarchivecsarformat"></a>3DS Files - Sound Archive (CSAR Format)



CSAR files are usually found in "RomFS:\sound\" folder, with extension ".bcsar"
(Binary CTR Sound Archive).

The CSAR archive contains CSEQ, CWSD, CBNK, CWAR files (and optionally CGRP).
Whereof, the CWAR file contains CWAV files.



## CSAR Header


```
  000h 4     ID "CSAR"
  004h 2     Byte Order (FEFFh)
  006h 2     Header Size (usually 40h)
  008h 4     Version (usually 02000000h) (02030200h in Miiverse-posting)
  00Ch 4     Total Filesize
  010h 4     Number of Blocks (usually 3 = STRG+INFO+FILE)

  038h 8     Padding to 20h-byte boundary (0)
```


```
 _________________________________ STRG Block _________________________________
```



## String Block Header


```
  000h 4     ID "STRG"
  004h 4     STRG Block Size (same as in CSAR header)
  008h 4+4   Filename String List  (RefID=2400h, Offset from STRG+8)
  010h 4+4   Filename Search Tree  (RefID=2401h, Offset from STRG+8)
```



## Filename String List


```
  000h 4          Number of Filenames   (eg. 40h)
  004h (4+4+4)*N  Filenames (RefID=1F01h, Offset from this Table, Size)
  ...  ..         Filename strings (uppercase ASCII, terminated by 00h)
```



## Filename Search Tree (Patricia Tree)


This is intended for fast file name lookup. For example, if the String List
contains only two entries with name "Fuck" and "Funeral", then one could find
the desired string with a single bit-test in the 3rd char (to avoid false
matches for strings that do not exist in the list, one could do a string
compare on the final result).

```
  000h       4  First Tree index for search (for testing the leftmost char)
  004h       4  Number of Tree entries      (usually NumNames*2-1)
  008h+N*14h 2  Entry Type               (0=Test, 1=Name)
  00Ah+N*14h 2  Bit number to be tested  (0=Bit7 of 1st char) ;\FFh-filled
  00Ch+N*14h 4  Next Tree index when test Result=0?           ; in Name entries
  010h+N*14h 4  Next Tree index when test Result=1?           ;/
  014h+N*14h 4  Name Index in STRG Block  (0..NumNames-1)     ;\FFh-filled
  018h+N*14h 4  Resource ID in INFO Block (NNxxxxxxh)         ;/in Test entries
```

To view the whole directory, simply ignore the Test entries, and extract the
Name+ID pairs from the Name entries.



## Resource IDs


The Resource IDs refer to entries in the INFO Block (the upper 8bit indicate a
List number, and lower 24bit contain the entry number in that list):

```
  ID          List        File Types                        Common Name prefix
  01xxxxxxh = Audio List  (CSEQ, CWSD files)                ;name SE,BGM
  02xxxxxxh = Set List    (folders for above Audio entries) ;name WSDSET,SEQSET
  03xxxxxxh = Bank List   (CBNK files)                      ;name BANK
  04xxxxxxh = Player List (...whatever?)                    ;name PLAYER
  05xxxxxxh = Wav Archive (CWAR files)  <-- unless nameless ;name WARC ;or none
  06xxxxxxh = Group List  (CGRP files)  <-- if any          ;name GROUP
```

Groups exist only in some files. Wav Archives do exist in all files, but they
are often completely omitted in the string tree (or have only one of them
listed in the string tree).


```

# <a name="3dsfilessoundwavestreamscstmformat"></a>3DS Files - Sound Wave Streams (CSTM Format)



CSTM files are very similar to CWAV files, with slightly differently arranged
data, and with an additional SEEK block.

Unknown if/which games or system titles are using CSTM files. They can be
reporedly found in following locations:

```
  - RomFS:\sound\stream\*.bcstm (eg. in Zelda Ocarina of Time)
  - Inside of a CSAR (unknown where exactly, maybe inside of CWAR blocks?)
  - CSAR's can contain RefID=220Dh entries for external CSTM file (eg. Zelda)
```

CSTM seems to be intended for streaming medium length recordings (longer than
normal CWAV instruments/effects, and shorter than fully fledged AAC/OGG/MP3
recordings).

## Tools


The following tools can play BCSTMs and convert them to other formats:

```
  Isabelle Sound Editor
  vgmstream
  Every File Explorer
```




# <a name="3dsfilessoundgroupcgrpformat"></a>3DS Files - Sound Group (CGRP Format)



CGRP files are included in some CSAR files, but not always (for example, a CGRP
can be found in the "AR Games" system title).

The purpose of CGRP is unknown. The INFO block seems to be mainly good for
re-ordering whatever indices. And the FILE block is somewhat empty.



## CGRP Header


```
  000h 4     ID "CGRP"
  004h 2     Byte Order (FEFFh)
  006h 2     Header Size (usually 40h)
  008h 4     Version?    (can be 01000000h)
  00Ch 4     Total Filesize
  010h 4     Number of Blocks (usually 2 = INFO+FILE)
  014h 4+4+4 INFO Block (RefID=7800h, Offset from CGRP+0, Size)
  020h 4+4+4 FILE Block (RefID=7801h, Offset from CGRP+0, Size)
  02Ch 14h   Padding to 20h-byte boundary (0)
```



## INFO Block


```
  000h 4       ID "INFO"
  004h 4       INFO Block Size (same as in CGRP Header)
  008h 4       Number of following List entries (eg. 40h)
  00Ch (4+4)*N List Entries (RefID=7900h, Offset from INFO+8)
  ...  ..      Padding to 20h-byte boundary (0)
```

List Entry Format:

```
  000h 4     Unknown (0..NumListEntries, in no specific order)
                     (and apparently one value skipped, since using values
                      in range 0..Num would be Num+1 values in total)
  004h 4     Unknown (FFFFFFFFh)
  008h 4     Unknown (FFFFFFFFh)
  00Ch 4     Unknown (0)
```



## FILE Block


```
  000h 4     ID "FILE"
  004h 4     FILE Block Size (same as in CGRP Header) (=20h)
  008h 18h   Padding to 20h-byte boundary (0)
```

Apart from the above header, there is no actual data in the FILE block, unless
it's meant to be a prefix for the following CWAR blocks in the CSAR file?




# <a name="3dsfilessoundidscsidformat"></a>3DS Files - Sound IDs (CSID Format)



Some titles have the CSAR file bundled with a separate CSID file with .csid
extension (eg. 3DS Health Safety RomFS:\sound\Main.csid and 3DS Instruction
Manual applet RomFS:\sound\Main.csid), which appears to be a relict from
devkit, used before/after generating the CSAR file.

The file contains Symbols and 32bit Resource IDs in ASCII, oddly, with an UTF-8
Byte Order Mark (EFh,BBh,BFh) in the file header.




# <a name="3dsfilessounddspbinarydsp1akacdc"></a>3DS Files - Sound DSP Binary (DSP1 aka .cdc)



Teak DSP binaries are usually having extension .cdc (supposedly unrelated to
the "cdc" codec services). DSP binaries are found in some titles (eg. 3DS eShop
RomFS:\sound\dspaudio.cdc, 3DS Browser Applet RomFS:\snd\dspaudio.cdc, and
(LZ11-compressed) 3DS Nintendo Zone RomFS:\dspaudio.cdc.nwcx).

Unknown if there is some kind of default DSP driver for use by other titles.



## Header (300h bytes)


```
  000h       100h RSA Signature across header bytes [100h-2FFh]
  100h       4    ID ("DSP1")
  104h       4    Total Filesize
  108h       1    Code Memory (bit0-7, for 8 32Kbyte blocks) (usually FFh)
  109h       1    Data Memory (bit0-7, for 8 32Kbyte blocks) (usually FFh)
  10Ah       3    Zero (00h,00h,00h)
  10Dh       1    Special Segment DSP Area (00h..02h) (usually 02h=Data)
  10Eh       1    Number of segments (must be 01h..0Ah)
  10Fh       1    Flags (bit0=RecvData, bit1=WithSpecialSegment)
  110h       4    Special Segment DSP Address in 16bit words
  114h       4    Special Segment Size in bytes (usually 214h)
  118h       8    Zero
 Segment record 0..9:
  120h+N*30h 4    Segment N File Offset in bytes (300h and up)
  124h+N*30h 4    Segment N DSP Address in 16bit words (max 1FFFFh or 0FFFFh)
  128h+N*30h 4    Segment N Size in bytes
  12Ch+N*30h 3    Segment N Zero
  12Fh+N*30h 1    Segment N DSP Area (00h..02h)
  130h+N*30h 20h  Segment N SHA256 across Segment Data
  300h       ..   Segment Data..
```


DSP Areas at [10Dh] and [124h+N\*30h] can be:

```
  0 = DSP Code Memory (at ARM:1FF00000h and up) (DSP:00000h..1FFFFh)
  1 = DSP Code Memory (at ARM:1FF00000h and up) (DSP:00000h..0FFFFh only?)
  2 = DSP Data Memory (at ARM:1FF40000h and up) (DSP:00000h..0FFFFh only?)
```



## Flags.bit0=RecvData


If set, DSP module calls DSP:RecvData on "all three registers" and expects them
to reply value, uh, that is... probably done as handshake AFTER uploading the
DSP binary?



## Flags.bit1=WithSpecialSegment


If set, 214h bytes are read from CfgS:GetConfigInfoBlk8 block 70000h, and then
copied to the special segment area/address. If the reading fails, zeroes are
written in its place. The purpose of this segment is currently unknown.




# <a name="3dsfilesmodulenwmwifidriver"></a>3DS Files - Module NWM (Wifi Driver)




## NWM File/versions


The wifi driver can be found in following locations (each console should have
one normal mode file, and one safe mode file):

```
  3ds:\title\00040130\00002d02\content\000000vv.app  ;NWM Normal mode (all 3DS)
  3ds:\title\00040130\00002d03\content\0000000v.app  ;NWM Safe mode (Old3DS)
  3ds:\title\00040130\20002d03\content\0000000v.app  ;NWM Safe mode (New3DS)
```

The .app file contains a compressed .code file (inside of the NCCH ExeFS). That
.code file contains ARM11 code and six datablocks with the actual Xtensa wifi
firmware (similar as in the DSi wifi firmware):

```
  Stub.data   038h bytes                   ;\Database and EEPROM reading stub
  Stub.code   316h bytes                   ; (always same size/content)
  Database    1E8h bytes                   ;/
  Main.type1  0FD3h, 10F7h, or 1B1Bh bytes ;\Main firmware (compressed)
  Main.type4  A053h, A482h, or A5EBh bytes ; (size/content varies per version)
  Main.type5  78F6h, or 7A2Eh bytes        ;/
```

There are a few safe mode versions, and dozen(s) of normal mode versions. The
versions may contain different ARM11 code, and/or different Xtensa code (as
shown above, there are at least three revisions of the Xtensa "Main" code
blocks (spotted in four different NWM files, so there may be much more
variations)).



## NWM Main Type1/4/5


There are three variants of the Main firmware, called Type1/4/5 (because the
ARM11 code uses "CMP r0,1/4/5" opcodes to determine which one to use).


## Type1 = Standard functions for normal internet access

  - Type1 supports the same commands/events as on DSi

## Type4 = Special AP Mode and whatever:

  - WMIcmd(004Ah..0052h) seem to be AP mode (alike Atheros cmd F00Bh..F013h)
  - WMIcmd(0053h,0055h..005Fh) unknown
  - WMIevent(101Dh,101Fh,1020h,1022h,1024h,1025h) unknown
  - Type4 can be used for normal internet access (when ignoring event 1025h)

## Type5 = Special MacFilter, GameID, and built-in SHA1 function

  - Contains ascii strings "MACFilter" and "GameID", and a built-in SHA1 function
  - WMIcmd(0060h..0073h) unknown
  - WMIevent(1021h,1023h,1026h,1027h) unknown
  - Type5 doesn't seem to support normal internet access (it can't even find APs)

Type4/5 are probably for Nintendo-specific special local network multiplayer
features, possibly related to "Streetpass" (in sleep mode?) and "DownloadPlay"
(for single gamepak), and/or other purposes.



## Addresses in ARM11 Pool


The ARM11 code does reference the Xtensa datablocks with "LDR Rd,=address"
opcodes, hence having the datablock addresses stored in the literal pool. The
pool isn't exactly intended to be used as "table of contents", but it can be
misused for that purpose:

Search for constant 00524C00h, check that constant 000003EDh is located at the
expected offset, then extract the datablock start/end addresses from the
corresponding pool locations, subtract 10000h to convert addresses to .code
file offsets.

The NWM file does contain two pools: One pool with the Main type1/4/5
addresses, followed by by larger pool with the same addresses, plus addresses
for the Database and EEPROM reading stub code/data.

Most files (3 of 4 known files) are using this pool structure:


## Newer Small Pool:

  - 00h main.dst (and stub.data.dst) ;CONST (00524C00h)
  - 04h whatever value               ;CONST (000003EDh)

  - 54h whatever.thumb.code.addr1

  - 5Ch whatever.thumb.code.addr3

There is at least one older file using this pool structure:


## Older Small Pool:

  - 00h main.dst (and stub.data.dst) ;CONST (00524C00h)
  - 04h maintype5.src.end

Moreover, there are dozens of unknown files, which may (or may not) use yet
different pool structures.




# <a name="nondsfilesrarcarchives"></a>Non-DS Files - RARC Archives



RARC archives are used in Wii and GameCube games like Super Mario Galaxy 1

duplicated folder data in both Folder List and Directory Entries.



## RARC Header (...probably bug-endian?)


```

# <a name="3dsconsoleids"></a>3DS Console IDs




## Hardware IDs


The main Console ID is stored in OTP memory:

- [3DS Crypto - PRNG and OTP Registers](#3dscryptoprngandotpregisters)
The eMMC CID is used for generating console specific encryption keys. The SD
card CID is also used for generating a SD card specific \<ID1> folder
name.

  130h 10h   AES-MAC (NAND dbs keyslot) across SHA256 across bytes [000h..12Fh]
```

Bytes [110h..11Fh] are used as KeyY for AES keyslots 30h, 34h, and 3Ah:

```
  Keyslot 30h  AES-CMACs for non-DSiWare in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\ and 3ds:\data\
  Keyslot 34h  AES encryption in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\
  Keyslot 3Ah  AES-CMACs for DSiWare in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\
```

Bytes [110h..11Fh] are also used to derive the \<ID0> folder name (see
below).

Movable.sed is transferred to the destination 3DS during a System Transfer. The
movable.sed keyY high u64 is updated on the source 3DS during a System
Transfer, and when doing a system format with System Settings.



## 3ds:\data\\<ID0>\ (\<ID0> folder on 3DS partition)



## sd:\Nintendo 3DS\\<ID0>\\<ID1>\ (\<ID0>\\<ID1> folder on SD card)


The \<ID0> folder name is derived by computing the SHA256 across
moveable.sed bytes [110h..11Fh], and then converting the first 4 words of the
SHA256 into a lowercase ASCII string (with the byte order reversed in each of
the four words, and with the last 4 words left unused).

The \<ID1> folder name is derived by swapping around the byte order of the
SD card CID: The CID is rotated 8-bits to the left (uh, that means the ending
00h padding byte is moved to begin?). Then, the word-order is reversed. And
then, the halfwords are converted into ascii string (with byte-order for each
byte-pair reversed), or so?



## 3ds:\rw\sys\SecureInfo\_A (111h bytes) (Region and Serial/Barcode)


```
  000h 100h  RSA-2048 signature across following 11h-bytes
  100h 1     Region (0=JPN, 1=USA, 2=EUR, 3=Reserved, 4=CHN, 5=KOR, 6=TWN)
  101h 1     Normally zero
  102h 0Fh   Serial/Barcode, without ending check digit (ASCII, zeropadded)
```

The serial/barcode consists of 2-3 letters, followed by 8 digits, followed by a
checksum digit.

The first letter indicates the console model:

```
  3DS             C  (or E for devunits)
  3DS XL/LL       S  (or R for devunits)
  2DS             A  (or P for devunits)
  New 3DS         Y  (or Yxx00 for devunits)
  New 3DS XL/LL   Q  (or Qxx00 for devunits)
  New 2DS XL/LL   N  (or Nxx01 for devunits)
```

The next 1-2 letter(s) indicate the region:

```
  JPN Japan                          JF,JH,JM
  USA North America                  W
  USA Middle East, Southeast Asia    S
  EUR Europe                         EF,EH,EM
  EUR Australia                      AG,AH
  CHN China (iQue)                   CF,CH,CM
  KOR South Korea                    KF,KH,KM
  TWN Taiwan                         ...unknown?
```

The checksum digit is found on the consoles barcode sticker, but isn't included
in the SecureInfo\_A file. However, the checksum can be calculated across
1st-8th digit (and ignoring the leading letters):

```
  9th = (250 - (1st+3rd+5th+7th) - 3*(2nd+4th+6th+8th)) mod 10
```

The RSA private key for retail is unknown. The private key for devkits is
included in the devkit system updater package.




# <a name="3dsemmcandmcuimages"></a>3DS eMMC and MCU Images




## eMMC Images


no$gba can load 3DS eMMC images from following files in no$gba folder
(currently that merely allows to view eMMC images in Window/Filesystem, ie.
there isn't any actual 3DS emulation supported in no$gba):

```
  3DS-#.mmc      ;\with "#" being the machine number ("1".."C")
  New3DS-#.mmc   ;/
```

For decrypting the image, CID and OTP needs to be stored at following eMMC
offsets:

```
  DC00h 20h   ID '3DS CID/OTP/NCSD/FIRM BackupData'
  DC20h 10h   eMMC CID (from eMMC command CMD10)
  DC30h D0h   Reserved
  DD00h 100h  OTP   (from ARM9 I/O address 10012000h)
  DE00h 200h  Copy of original NCSD  (from eMMC offset 00000000h)
  E000h 1000h Copy of original FIRM0 (from eMMC offset 0B130000h)
  F000h 1000h Copy of original FIRM1 (from eMMC offset 0B530000h)
```

The copy of original NCSD/FIRM0/FIRM1 allows to uninstall sighax-based stuff
(or to install such stuff; doing that works even without having OTP dump, as
long as the unencrypted content of the NCSD/FIRM0/FIRM1 sectors is known).



## MCU Firmware Images


The MCU image can be viewed in no$gba's RL78 disassembler (via Alt+W, R). The
image is loaded from following files in no$gba directory:

```
  3DS.mcu
  New3DS.mcu
```

The file should contain a copy of the whole 8000h-byte MCU flash memory:

```
  0000h 1000h Part 1 current version
  1000h 1000h Part 1 old version backup
  2000h 3000h Part 2 current version
  5000h 3000h Part 2 old version backup
```

If the old version areas aren't dumped, best leave them empty.



## Atheros Wifi ROM image


The Wifi ROM image can be viewed in no$gba's Xtensa disassembler (via Alt+W,
X). The image is loaded from following file (in no$gba directory):

```
  AR6014G.ROM  ;3DS wifi chip     (256Kbytes)
```

(that way the NFC could be also accessed via SPI/UART whilst internally talking

# <a name="armcpuoverview"></a>ARM CPU Overview



The ARM7TDMI is a 32bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU, designed
by ARM (Advanced RISC Machines), and designed for both high performance and low
power consumption.



## Fast Execution


Depending on the CPU state, all opcodes are sized 32bit or 16bit (that's
counting both the opcode bits and its parameters bits) providing fast decoding
and execution. Additionally, pipelining allows - (a) one instruction to be
executed while (b) the next instruction is decoded and (c) the next instruction
is fetched from memory - all at the same time.



## Data Formats


The CPU manages to deal with 8bit, 16bit, and 32bit data, that are called:

```
   8bit - Byte
  16bit - Halfword
  32bit - Word
```



## The two CPU states


As mentioned above, two CPU states exist:

- ARM state: Uses the full 32bit instruction set (32bit opcodes)

- THUMB state: Uses a cutdown 16bit instruction set (16bit opcodes)

Regardless of the opcode-width, both states are using 32bit registers, allowing
32bit memory addressing as well as 32bit arithmetic/logical operations.



## When to use ARM state


Basically, there are two advantages in ARM state:

- - Each single opcode provides more functionality, resulting
    - in faster execution when using a 32bit bus memory system
    - (such like opcodes stored in GBA Work RAM).
- - All registers R0-R15 can be accessed directly.

The downsides are:

- - Not so fast when using 16bit memory system
    - (but it still works though).
- - Program code occupies more memory space.



## When to use THUMB state


There are two major advantages in THUMB state:

- - Faster execution up to approx 160% when using a 16bit bus
    - memory system (such like opcodes stored in GBA GamePak ROM).
- - Reduces code size, decreases memory overload down to approx 65%.

The disadvantages are:

- - Not as multi-functional opcodes as in ARM state, so it will
    - be sometimes required use more than one opcode to gain a
    - similar result as for a single opcode in ARM state.
- - Most opcodes allow only registers R0-R7 to be used directly.



## Combining ARM and THUMB state


Switching between ARM and THUMB state is done by a normal branch (BX)
instruction which takes only a handful of cycles to execute (allowing to change
states as often as desired - with almost no overload).


Also, as both ARM and THUMB are using the same register set, it is possible to
pass data between ARM and THUMB mode very easily.


The best memory & execution performance can be gained by combining both
states: THUMB for normal program code, and ARM code for timing critical
subroutines (such like interrupt handlers, or complicated algorithms).


Note: ARM and THUMB code cannot be executed simultaneously.



## Automatic state changes


Beside for the above manual state switching by using BX instructions, the
following situations involve automatic state changes:

- CPU switches to ARM state when executing an exception

- User switches back to old state when leaving an exception




# <a name="armcpuregisterset"></a>ARM CPU Register Set




## Overview


The following table shows the ARM7TDMI register set which is available in each
mode. There's a total of 37 registers (32bit each), 31 general registers (Rxx)
and 6 status registers (xPSR).

Note that only some registers are 'banked', for example, each mode has it's own
R14 register: called R14, R14\_fiq, R14\_svc, etc. for each mode respectively.

However, other registers are not banked, for example, each mode is using the
same R0 register, so writing to R0 will always affect the content of R0 in
other modes also.

## R0-R12 Registers (General Purpose Registers)


These thirteen registers may be used for whatever general purposes. Basically,
each is having same functionality and performance, ie. there is no 'fast
accumulator' for arithmetic operations, and no 'special pointer register' for
memory addressing.

However, in THUMB mode only R0-R7 (Lo registers) may be accessed freely, while
R8-R12 and up (Hi registers) can be accessed only by some instructions.



## R13 Register (SP)


This register is used as Stack Pointer (SP) in THUMB state. While in ARM state
the user may decided to use R13 and/or other register(s) as stack pointer(s),
or as general purpose register.

As shown in the table above, there's a separate R13 register in each mode, and
(when used as SP) each exception handler may (and MUST!) use its own stack.



## R14 Register (LR)


This register is used as Link Register (LR). That is, when calling to a
sub-routine by a Branch with Link (BL) instruction, then the return address
(ie. old value of PC) is saved in this register.

Storing the return address in the LR register is obviously faster than pushing
it into memory, however, as there's only one LR register for each mode, the
user must manually push its content before issuing 'nested' subroutines.

Same happens when an exception is called, PC is saved in LR of new mode.

Note: In ARM mode, R14 may be used as general purpose register also, provided
that above usage as LR register isn't required.



## R15 Register (PC)


R15 is always used as program counter (PC). Note that when reading R15, this
will usually return a value of PC+nn because of read-ahead (pipelining),
whereas 'nn' depends on the instruction and on the CPU state (ARM or THUMB).



## CPSR and SPSR (Program Status Registers) (ARMv3 and up)


The current condition codes (flags) and CPU control bits are stored in the CPSR
register. When an exception arises, the old CPSR is saved in the SPSR of the
respective exception-mode (much like PC is saved in LR).

For details refer to chapter about CPU Flags.




# <a name="armcpuflagsconditionfieldcond"></a>ARM CPU Flags & Condition Field (cond)




## ARM Condition Field {cond}


The opcode {cond} suffixes can be used for conditionally executed code based on
the C,N,Z,V flags in CPSR register. For example: BEQ = Branch if Equal, MOVMI =
Move if Signed.

In ARM mode, {cond} can be used with all opcodes (except for a few newer ARMv5
instructions: BKPT, PLD, CDP2, LDC2, MCR2, MRC2, STC2, and BLX\_imm are
nonconditional; however BLX\_reg can be conditional).

In THUMB mode, {cond} can be used only for branch opcodes.

```
  Code Suffix Flags         Meaning
  0:   EQ     Z=1           equal (zero) (same)
  1:   NE     Z=0           not equal (nonzero) (not same)
  2:   CS/HS  C=1           unsigned higher or same (carry set)
  3:   CC/LO  C=0           unsigned lower (carry cleared)
  4:   MI     N=1           signed negative (minus)
  5:   PL     N=0           signed positive or zero (plus)
  6:   VS     V=1           signed overflow (V set)
  7:   VC     V=0           signed no overflow (V cleared)
  8:   HI     C=1 and Z=0   unsigned higher
  9:   LS     C=0 or Z=1    unsigned lower or same
  A:   GE     N=V           signed greater or equal
  B:   LT     N<>V          signed less than
  C:   GT     Z=0 and N=V   signed greater than
  D:   LE     Z=1 or N<>V   signed less or equal
  E:   AL     -             always (the "AL" suffix can be omitted)
  F:   NV     -             never (ARMv1,v2 only) (Reserved ARMv3 and up)
```

Execution Time: If condition=false: 1S cycle. Otherwise: as specified for the
respective opcode.

```



## Bit 31-28: Condition Code Flags (N,Z,C,V)


These bits reflect results of logical or arithmetic instructions. In ARM mode,
it is often optionally whether an instruction should modify flags or not, for
example, it is possible to execute a SUB instruction that does NOT modify the
condition flags.

In ARM state, all instructions can be executed conditionally depending on the
settings of the flags, such like MOVEQ (Move if Z=1). While In THUMB state,
only Branch instructions (jumps) can be made conditionally.



## Bit 27: Sticky Overflow Flag (Q) - ARMv5TE and ARMv5TExP and up only


Used by QADD, QSUB, QDADD, QDSUB, SMLAxy, and SMLAWy only. These opcodes set
the Q-flag in case of overflows, but leave it unchanged otherwise. The Q-flag
can be tested/reset by MSR/MRS opcodes only.



## Bit 27-8: Reserved Bits (except Bit 27 on ARMv5TE and up, see above)


These bits are reserved for possible future implementations. For best forwards
compatibility, the user should never change the state of these bits, and should
not expect these bits to be set to a specific value.



## Bit 7-0: Control Bits (I,F,T,M4-M0)


These bits may change when an exception occurs. In privileged modes (non-user
modes) they may be also changed manually.

The interrupt bits I and F are used to disable IRQ and FIQ interrupts
respectively (a setting of "1" means disabled).

The T Bit signalizes the current state of the CPU (0=ARM, 1=THUMB), this bit
should never be changed manually - instead, changing between ARM and THUMB
state must be done by BX instructions.

The Mode Bits M4-M0 contain the current operating mode.

  11111b 1Fh 31 - System (privileged 'User' mode) (ARMv4 and up)
```

Writing any other values into the Mode bits is not allowed.



## Saved Program Status Registers (SPSR\_\<mode>)


Additionally to above CPSR, five Saved Program Status Registers exist:

SPSR\_fiq, SPSR\_svc, SPSR\_abt, SPSR\_irq, SPSR\_und

Whenever the CPU enters an exception, the current status register (CPSR) is
copied to the respective SPSR\_\<mode> register. Note that there is only
one SPSR for each mode, so nested exceptions inside of the same mode are
allowed only if the exception handler saves the content of SPSR in memory.

For example, for an IRQ exception: IRQ-mode is entered, and CPSR is copied to
SPSR\_irq. If the interrupt handler wants to enable nested IRQs, then it must
first push SPSR\_irq before doing so.




# <a name="armcpu26bitmemoryinterface"></a>ARM CPU 26bit Memory Interface



The 26bit Memory Interface was used by ARMv1 and ARMv2. The 32bit interface is
used by ARMv3 and newer, however, 26bit backward compatibility was included in
all ARMv3 (except ARMv3G), and optionally in some non-T variants of ARMv4.



## Format of R15 in 26bit Mode (Program Counter Register)

  1-0   M1,M0    Mode (0=User, 1=FIQ, 2=IRQ, 3=Supervisor)
```

Branches with +/-32M range wrap the PC register, and can reach all 64M memory.

If R15 is specified in bit16-19 of an opcode, then NZCVIF and M0,1 are masked
(zero), otherwise the full 32bits are used.



## Writing to R15


ALU opcodes with S=1, and LDM opcodes with PSR=1 can write to all 32bits in R15
(in 26bit mode, that is allowed even in user mode, though it does then affect
only NZCF, not the write protected IFMM bits ???), other opcodes which write to
R15 will modify only the program counter bits. Also, special CMP/CMN/TST/TEQ{P}
opcodes can be used to write to the PSR bits in R15 without modifying the PC
bits.



## Exceptions


SWIs, Reset, Data/Prefetch Aborts and Undefined instructions enter Supervisor
mode. Interrupts enter IRQ and FIQ mode. Additionally, a special 26bit Address
Exception exists, which enters Supervisor mode on accesses to memory
addresses>=64M as follows:

```
  R14_svc = PC ($+8, including old PSR bits)
  M1,M0 = 11b = supervisor mode, F=same, I=1, PC=14h,
  to continue at the fault location, return by SUBS PC,LR,8.
```

32bit CPUs with 26bit compatibility mode can be configured to switch into 32bit
mode when encountering exceptions.




# <a name="armcpuexceptions"></a>ARM CPU Exceptions




## Exception Vectors


The following are the exception vectors in memory. That is, when an exception
arises, CPU is switched into ARM state, and the program counter (PC) is loaded
by the respective address.

```
  Address  Prio  Exception                  Mode on Entry      Interrupt Flags
  BASE+00h 1     Reset                      Supervisor (_svc)  I=1, F=1
  BASE+04h 7     Undefined Instruction      Undefined  (_und)  I=1, F=unchanged
  BASE+08h 6     Software Interrupt (SWI)   Supervisor (_svc)  I=1, F=unchanged
  BASE+0Ch 5     Prefetch Abort             Abort      (_abt)  I=1, F=unchanged
  BASE+10h 2     Data Abort                 Abort      (_abt)  I=1, F=unchanged
  BASE+14h ??    Address Exceeds 26bit      Supervisor (_svc)  I=1, F=unchanged
  BASE+18h 4     Normal Interrupt (IRQ)     IRQ        (_irq)  I=1, F=unchanged
  BASE+1Ch 3     Fast Interrupt (FIQ)       FIQ        (_fiq)  I=1, F=1
```

BASE is normally 00000000h, but may be optionally FFFF0000h in some ARM CPUs.
Priority for simultaneously occuring exceptions ranges from Prio=1=Highest to
Prio=7=Lowest.

As there's only space for one ARM opcode at each of the above addresses, it'd
be usually recommended to deposit a Branch opcode into each vector, which'd
then redirect to the actual exception handlers address.



## Actions performed by CPU when entering an exception


```
  - R14_<new mode>=PC+nn   ;save old PC, ie. return address
  - SPSR_<new mode>=CPSR   ;save old flags
  - CPSR new T,M bits      ;set to T=0 (ARM state), and M4-0=new mode
  - CPSR new I bit         ;IRQs disabled (I=1), done by ALL exceptions
  - CPSR new F bit         ;FIQs disabled (F=1), done by Reset and FIQ only
  - PC=exception_vector    ;see table above
```

Above "PC+nn" depends on the type of exception. Basically, in ARM state that
nn-offset is caused by pipelining, and in THUMB state an identical ARM-style
'offset' is generated (even though the 'base address' may be only
halfword-aligned).



## Required user-handler actions when returning from an exception


Restore any general registers (R0-R14) which might have been modified by the
exception handler. Use return-instruction as listed in the respective
descriptions below, this will both restore PC and CPSR - that automatically
involves that the old CPU state (THUMB or ARM) as well as old state of FIQ and
IRQ disable flags are restored.

As mentioned above (see action on entering...), the return address is always
saved in ARM-style format, so that exception handler may use the same
return-instruction, regardless of whether the exception has been generated from
inside of ARM or THUMB state.



## FIQ (Fast Interrupt Request)


This interrupt is generated by a LOW level on the nFIQ input. It is supposed to
process timing critical interrupts at a high priority, as fast as possible.

Additionally to the common banked registers (R13\_fiq,R14\_fiq), five extra
banked registers (R8\_fiq-R12\_fiq) are available in FIQ mode. The exception
handler may freely access these registers without modifying the main programs
R8-R12 registers (and without having to save that registers on stack).

In privileged (non-user) modes, FIQs may be also manually disabled by setting
the F Bit in CPSR.



## IRQ (Normal Interrupt Request)


This interrupt is generated by a LOW level on the nIRQ input. Unlike FIQ, the
IRQ mode is not having its own banked R8-R12 registers.

IRQ is having lower priority than FIQ, and IRQs are automatically disabled when
a FIQ exception becomes executed. In privileged (non-user) modes, IRQs may be
also manually disabled by setting the I Bit in CPSR.

To return from IRQ Mode (continuing at following opcode):

```
  SUBS PC,R14,4   ;both PC=R14_irq-4, and CPSR=SPSR_irq
```



## Software Interrupt


Generated by a software interrupt instruction (SWI). Recommended to request a
supervisor (operating system) function. The SWI instruction may also contain a
parameter in the 'comment field' of the opcode:

In case that your main program issues SWIs from both inside of THUMB and ARM
states, then your exception handler must separate between 24bit comment fields
in ARM opcodes, and 8bit comment fields in THUMB opcodes (if necessary
determine old state by examining T Bit in SPSR\_svc); However, in Little Endian
mode, you could use only the most significant 8bits of the 24bit ARM comment
field (as done in the GBA, for example) - the exception handler could then
process the BYTE at [R14-2], regardless of whether it's been called from ARM or
THUMB state.

To return from Supervisor Mode (continuing at following opcode):

```
  MOVS PC,R14   ;both PC=R14_svc, and CPSR=SPSR_svc
```

Note: Like all other exceptions, SWIs are always executed in ARM state, no
matter whether it's been caused by an ARM or THUMB state SWI instruction.



## Undefined Instruction Exception (supported by ARMv3 and up)


This exception is generated when the CPU comes across an instruction which it
cannot handle. Most likely signalizing that the program has locked up, and that
an errormessage should be displayed.

However, it might be also used to emulate custom functions, ie. as an
additional 'SWI' instruction (which'd use R14\_und and SPSR\_und though, and it'd
thus allow to execute the Undefined Instruction handler from inside of
Supervisor mode without having to save R14\_svc and SPSR\_svc).

To return from Undefined Mode (continuing at following opcode):

```
  MOVS PC,R14   ;both PC=R14_und, and CPSR=SPSR_und
```

Note that not all unused opcodes are necessarily producing an exception, for
example, an ARM state Multiply instruction with Bit6=1 would be blindly
accepted as 'legal' opcode.



## Abort (supported by ARMv3 and up)


Aborts (page faults) are mostly supposed for virtual memory systems (ie. not
used in GBA, as far as I know), otherwise they might be used just to display an
error message. Two types of aborts exists:

- Prefetch Abort (occurs during an instruction prefetch)

- Prefetch Abort (also occurs on BKPT opcodes, ARMv5 and up)

- Data Abort (occurs during a data access)

A virtual memory systems abort handler would then most likely determine the
fault address: For prefetch abort that's just "R14\_abt-4". For Data abort, the
THUMB or ARM instruction at "R14\_abt-8" needs to be 'disassembled' in order to
determine the addressed data in memory.

The handler would then fix the error by loading the respective memory page into
physical memory, and then retry to execute the SAME instruction again, by
returning as follows:

```
  prefetch abort: SUBS PC,R14,#4   ;PC=R14_abt-4, and CPSR=SPSR_abt
  data abort:     SUBS PC,R14,#8   ;PC=R14_abt-8, and CPSR=SPSR_abt
```

Separate exception vectors for prefetch/data abort exists, each should use the
respective return instruction as shown above.



## Address Exceeds 26bit


This exception can occur only on old ARM CPUs with 26bit address scheme (or in
26bit backwards compatibility mode).



## Reset


Forces PC=VVVV0000h, and forces control bits of CPSR to T=0 (ARM state), F=1
and I=1 (disable FIQ and IRQ), and M4-0=10011b (Supervisor mode).




# <a name="armcpumemoryalignments"></a>ARM CPU Memory Alignments



The CPU does NOT support accessing mis-aligned addresses (which would be rather
slow because it'd have to merge/split that data into two accesses).

When reading/writing code/data to/from memory, Words and Halfwords must be
located at well-aligned memory address, ie. 32bit words aligned by 4, and 16bit
halfwords aligned by 2.



## Mis-aligned STR,STRH,STM,LDM,LDRD,STRD,PUSH,POP (forced align)


The mis-aligned low bit(s) are ignored, the memory access goes to a forcibly
aligned (rounded-down) memory address.

For LDRD/STRD, it isn't clearly defined if the address must be aligned by 8 (on
the NDS, align-4 seems to be okay) (align-8 may be required on other CPUs with
64bit databus).



## Mis-aligned LDR,SWP (rotated read)


Reads from forcibly aligned address "addr AND (NOT 3)", and does then rotate
the data as "ROR (addr AND 3)\*8". That effect is internally used by LDRB and
LDRH opcodes (which do then mask-out the unused bits).

The SWP opcode works like a combination of LDR and STR, that means, it does
read-rotated, but does write-unrotated.



## Mis-aligned LDRH,LDRSH (does or does not do strange things)


On ARM9 aka ARMv5 aka NDS9:

```
  LDRH Rd,[odd]   -->  LDRH Rd,[odd-1]        ;forced align
  LDRSH Rd,[odd]  -->  LDRSH Rd,[odd-1]       ;forced align
```

On ARM7 aka ARMv4 aka NDS7/GBA:

```
  LDRH Rd,[odd]   -->  LDRH Rd,[odd-1] ROR 8  ;read to bit0-7 and bit24-31
  LDRSH Rd,[odd]  -->  LDRSB Rd,[odd]         ;sign-expand BYTE value
```



## Mis-aligned PC/R15 (branch opcodes, or MOV/ALU/LDR with Rd=R15)


For ARM code, the low bits of the target address should be usually zero,
otherwise, R15 is forcibly aligned by clearing the lower two bits.

For THUMB code, the low bit of the target address may/should/must be set, the
bit is (or is not) interpreted as thumb-bit (depending on the opcode), and R15
is then forcibly aligned by clearing the lower bit.

In short, R15 will be always forcibly aligned, so mis-aligned branches won't
have effect on subsequent opcodes that use R15, or [R15+disp] as operand.

# <a name="armopcodesbranchandbranchwithlinkbblbxblxswibkpt"></a>ARM Opcodes: Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL, BX, BLX, SWI, BKPT)




## Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL, BLX\_imm)


Branch (B) is supposed to jump to a subroutine. Branch with Link is meant to be
used to call to a subroutine, return address is then saved in R14.

```
  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition (must be 1111b for BLX)
  27-25  Must be "101" for this instruction
  24     Opcode (0-1) (or Halfword Offset for BLX)
          0: B{cond} label    ;branch            PC=PC+8+nn*4
          1: BL{cond} label   ;branch/link       PC=PC+8+nn*4, LR=PC+4
          H: BLX label ;ARM9  ;branch/link/thumb PC=PC+8+nn*4+H*2, LR=PC+4, T=1
  23-0   nn - Signed Offset, step 4      (-32M..+32M in steps of 4)
```

Branch with Link can be used to 'call' to a sub-routine, which may then
'return' by MOV PC,R14 for example.

Execution Time: 2S + 1N

Return: No flags affected.



## Branch and Exchange (BX, BLX\_reg)


```
  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition
  27-8   Must be "0001.0010.1111.1111.1111" for this instruction
  7-4    Opcode
          0001b: BX{cond}  Rn    ;PC=Rn, T=Rn.0   (ARMv4T and ARMv5 and up)
          0010b: BXJ{cond} Rn    ;Change to Jazelle bytecode (ARMv5TEJ and up)
          0011b: BLX{cond} Rn    ;PC=Rn, T=Rn.0, LR=PC+4     (ARMv5 and up)
  3-0    Rn - Operand Register  (R0-R14)
```

Switching to THUMB Mode: Set Bit 0 of the value in Rn to 1, program continues
then at Rn-1 in THUMB mode.

Using BLX R14 is possible (sets PC=Old\_LR, and New\_LR=retadr).

Using BX R15 acts as BX $+8 (tested and working on ARM7/ARM9, although it isn't
officially defined as predictable behaviour).

Execution Time: 2S + 1N

Return: No flags affected.



## Notes on BXJ (Branch or change to Jazelle bytecode state):


If Jazelle is suppored/enabled: Executes Java bytecode at address R14

If Jazelle is NOT suppored/enabled: Behaves exactly same as BX Rn

That is, R14 is the byte code address, and Rn is an ARM/THUMB error handler.

Supported on ARMv5TEJ and ARMv6 and up.



## Branch via ALU, LDR, LDM


Most ALU, LDR, LDM opcodes can also change PC/R15.



## Software Interrupt (SWI/BKPT) (svc/abt exceptions)


SWI supposed for calls to the operating system - Enter Supervisor mode (SVC) in
ARM state. BKPT intended for debugging - enters Abort mode in ARM state via
Prefetch Abort vector.

```
  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition (must be 1110b for BKPT, ie. Condition=always)
  27-24  Opcode
          1111b: SWI{cond} nn   ;software interrupt
          0001b: BKPT      nn   ;breakpoint (ARMv5 and up)
  For SWI:
   23-0   nn - Comment Field, ignored by processor (24bit value)
  For BKPT:
   23-20  Must be 0010b for BKPT
   19-8   nn - upper 12bits of comment field, ignored by processor
   7-4    Must be 0111b for BKPT
   3-0    nn - lower 4bits of comment field, ignored by processor
```

Execution Time: 2S+1N

The exception handler may interprete the SWI Comment Field by examining the
lower 24bit of the 32bit opcode opcode at [R14\_svc-4]. If your are also using
SWI's from inside of THUMB, then the SWI handler must examine the T Bit
SPSR\_svc in order to determine whether it's been a THUMB SWI - and if so,
examine the lower 8bit of the 16bit opcode opcode at [R14\_svc-2].

For Returning from SWI use "MOVS PC,R14", that instruction does restore both PC
and CPSR, ie. PC=R14\_svc, and CPSR=SPSR\_svc.

Nesting SWIs: SPSR\_svc and R14\_svc should be saved on stack before either
invoking nested SWIs, or (if the IRQ handler uses SWIs) before enabling IRQs.

Execution SWI/BKPT:

```
  R14_svc=PC+4     R14_abt=PC+4   ;save return address
  SPSR_svc=CPSR    SPSR_abt=CPSR  ;save CPSR flags
  CPSR=<changed>   CPSR=<changed> ;Enter svc/abt, ARM state, IRQs disabled
  PC=VVVV0008h     PC=VVVV000Ch   ;jump to SWI/PrefetchAbort vector address
```



## Undefined Instruction (und exception)


```
  Bit    Expl.
  31-28  Condition
  27-25  Must be 011b for this instruction
  24-5   Reserved for future use
  4      Must be 1b for this instruction
  3-0    Reserved for future use
```

No assembler mnemonic exists, following bitstreams are (not) reserved.

```
  cond011xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1xxxx - reserved for future use (except below).
  cond01111111xxxxxxxxxxxx1111xxxx - free for user.
```

Note: ARMv6 does use the "reserved for future" space for the new SIMD opcodes
(but still has the "free for user" space available as "undefined").

Execution time: 2S+1I+1N.

    7-0    nn - 2nd Operand Unsigned 8bit Immediate
```



## Second Operand (Op2)


This may be a shifted register, or a shifted immediate. See Bit 25 and 11-0.

Unshifted Register: Specify Op2 as "Rm", assembler converts to "Rm,LSL#0".

Shifted Register: Specify as "Rm,SSS#Is" or "Rm,SSS Rs" (SSS=LSL/LSR/ASR/ROR).

Immediate: Specify as 32bit value, for example: "#000NN000h", assembler should
automatically convert into "#0NNh,ROR#0ssh" as far as possible (ie. as far as a
section of not more than 8bits of the immediate is non-zero).



## Zero Shift Amount (Shift Register by Immediate, with Immediate=0)


```
  LSL#0: No shift performed, ie. directly Op2=Rm, the C flag is NOT affected.
  LSR#0: Interpreted as LSR#32, ie. Op2 becomes zero, C becomes Bit 31 of Rm.
  ASR#0: Interpreted as ASR#32, ie. Op2 and C are filled by Bit 31 of Rm.
  ROR#0: Interpreted as RRX#1 (RCR), like ROR#1, but Op2 Bit 31 set to old C.
```

In source code, LSR#32, ASR#32, and RRX#1 should be specified as such -
attempts to specify LSR#0, ASR#0, or ROR#0 will be internally converted to
LSL#0 by the assembler.



## Using R15 (PC)


When using R15 as Destination (Rd), note below CPSR description and Execution
time description.

When using R15 as operand (Rm or Rn), the returned value depends on the
instruction: PC+12 if I=0,R=1 (shift by register), otherwise PC+8 (shift by
immediate).



## Returned CPSR Flags


If S=1, Rd\<>R15, logical operations (AND,EOR,TST,TEQ,ORR,MOV,BIC,MVN):

```
  V=not affected
  C=carryflag of shift operation (not affected if LSL#0 or Rs=00h)
  Z=zeroflag of result
  N=signflag of result (result bit 31)
```

If S=1, Rd\<>R15, arithmetic operations (SUB,RSB,ADD,ADC,SBC,RSC,CMP,CMN):

```
  V=overflowflag of result
  C=carryflag of result
  Z=zeroflag of result
  N=signflag of result (result bit 31)
```

IF S=1, with unused Rd bits=1111b, {P} opcodes (CMPP/CMNP/TSTP/TEQP):

```
  R15=result  ;modify PSR bits in R15, ARMv2 and below only.
  In user mode only N,Z,C,V bits of R15 can be changed.
  In other modes additionally I,F,M1,M0 can be changed.
  The PC bits in R15 are left unchanged in all modes.
```

If S=1, Rd=R15; should not be used in user mode:

```
  CPSR = SPSR_<current mode>
  PC = result
  For example: MOVS PC,R14  ;return from SWI (PC=R14_svc, CPSR=SPSR_svc).
```

If S=0: Flags are not affected (not allowed for CMP,CMN,TEQ,TST).


The instruction "MOV R0,R0" is used as "NOP" opcode in 32bit ARM state.

Execution Time: (1+p)S+rI+pN. Whereas r=1 if I=0 and R=1 (ie. shift by
register); otherwise r=0. And p=1 if Rd=R15; otherwise p=0.

## Multiply and Multiply-Accumulate (MUL, MLA)


Restrictions: Rd may not be same as Rm. Rd,Rn,Rs,Rm may not be R15.

Note: Only the lower 32bit of the internal 64bit result are stored in Rd, thus
no sign/zero extension is required and MUL and MLA can be used for both signed
and unsigned calculations!

Execution Time: 1S+mI for MUL, and 1S+(m+1)I for MLA. Whereas 'm' depends on
whether/how many most significant bits of Rs are all zero or all one. That is
m=1 for Bit 31-8, m=2 for Bit 31-16, m=3 for Bit 31-24, and m=4 otherwise.

Flags (if S=1): Z=zeroflag, N=signflag, C=destroyed (ARMv4 and below) or C=not
affected (ARMv5 and up), V=not affected. MUL/MLA supported by ARMv2 and up.



## Multiply Long and Multiply-Accumulate Long (MULL, MLAL)


Optionally supported, INCLUDED in ARMv3M, EXCLUDED in ARMv4xM/ARMv5xM.

Restrictions: RdHi,RdLo,Rm must be different registers. R15 may not be used.

Execution Time: 1S+(m+1)I for MULL, and 1S+(m+2)I for MLAL. Whereas 'm' depends
on whether/how many most significant bits of Rs are "all zero" (UMULL/UMLAL) or
"all zero or all one" (SMULL,SMLAL). That is m=1 for Bit31-8, m=2 for Bit31-16,
m=3 for Bit31-24, and m=4 otherwise.

Flags (if S=1): Z=zeroflag, N=signflag, C=destroyed (ARMv4 and below) or C=not
affected (ARMv5 and up), V=destroyed??? (ARMv4 and below???) or V=not affected
(ARMv5 and up).



## Signed Halfword Multiply (SMLAxy,SMLAWy,SMLALxy,SMULxy,SMULWy)


Supported by E variants of ARMv5 and up, ie. ARMv5TE(xP).

Q-flag gets set on 32bit SMLAxy/SMLAWy addition overflows, however, the result
is NOT truncated (as it'd be done with QADD opcodes).

Q-flag is NOT affected on (rare) 64bit SMLALxy addition overflows.

SMULxy/SMULWy cannot overflow, and thus leave Q-flag unchanged as well.

NZCV-flags are not affected by Halfword multiplies.

Execution Time: 1S+Interlock (SMULxy,SMLAxy,SMULWx,SMLAWx)

Execution Time: 1S+1I+Interlock (SMLALxy)



## Unsigned Multiply Accumulate Accumulate Long (UMAAL)


Multiply with two 32bit additions, supposed to be used for cryptography.

Flags are not affected.

ARMv6 and above.

```

Supported by E variants of ARMv5 and up, ie. ARMv5TE(xP).

Execution time: 1S+Interlock.

Results truncated to signed 32bit range in case of overflows, with the Q-flag
being set (and being left unchanged otherwise). NZCV flags are not affected.

Note: Rn\*2 is internally processed first, and may get truncated - even if the
final result would fit into range.

## Store Return State (SRS) (stores the R14 and SPSR of the current mode)


to the word at the specified address and the following word respectively. The
address is determined from the banked version of R13 belonging to a specified
mode.

```
  Syntax
  SRS<addressing_mode> #<mode>{!}   ;<-- original (pre-UAL)
  SRS<addressing_mode> sp!,#<mode>  ;<-- more common (UAL)
```

\<addressing\_mode>: Is similar to the \<addressing\_mode> in LDM and
STM instructions, see Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on page
A5-41, but with the following differences:

- The base register, Rn, is the banked version of R13 for the mode specified by
\<mode>, rather than the current mode.

- The number of registers to store is 2.

- The register list is {R14, SPSR}, with both R14 and the SPSR being the
versions belonging to the current mode.

\<mode> Specifies the number of the mode whose banked register is used as
the base register for \<addressing\_mode>. The mode number is the 5-bit
encoding of the chosen mode in a PSR, as described in The mode bits on page
A2-14.

! If present, sets the W bit. This causes the instruction to write a modified
value back to its base register, in a manner similar to that specified for
Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on page A5-41. If ! is omitted, the
W bit is 0 and the instruction does not change the base register.

## Return From Exception (RFE) (RFEDA, RFEDB, RFEIA, RFEIB)


loads the PC and the CPSR from the word at the specified address and the

following word respectively.

```
  Syntax
  RFE<addressing_mode> Rn{!}
```

\<addressing\_mode>: Is similar to the \<addressing\_mode> in LDM and
STM instructions, see Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on page
A5-41, but with the following differences:

- The number of registers to load is 2.

- The register list is {PC, CPSR}.

\<Rn> Specifies the base register to be used by \<addressing\_mode>.
If R15 is specified as the base register, the result is UNPREDICTABLE.

! If present, sets the W bit. This causes the instruction to write a modified
value back to its base register, in a manner similar to that specified for
Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on page A5-41. If ! is omitted, the
W bit is 0 and the instruction does not change the base register.

While RFE supports different base registers, a general usage case is where Rn
== sp (the stack pointer), held in R13. The instruction can then be used as the
return method associated with instructions SRS and CPS. See New instructions to
improve exception handling on page A2-28 for more details.

The alias was invented in ARMv6 for THUMB and ARM code (apparently because
pre-UAL THUMB syntax couldn't distinguish between MOV and MOVS) (ie. in ARM
it's useless, but in THUMB it does allow using a formerly undocumented opcode).

## Select Bytes from 1st/2nd operand, depending on GE flags (SEL)


Syntax

```
  SEL{cond} Rd, Rn, Rm
```

Operation

if ConditionPassed(cond) then

Rd[7:0] = if GE[0] == 1 then Rn[7:0] else Rm[7:0]

Rd[15:8] = if GE[1] == 1 then Rn[15:8] else Rm[15:8]

Rd[23:16] = if GE[2] == 1 then Rn[23:16] else Rm[23:16]

Rd[31:24] = if GE[3] == 1 then Rn[31:24] else Rm[31:24]

Usage

Use SEL after instructions such as SADD8, SADD16, SSUB8, SSUB16, UADD8, UADD16,
USUB8, USUB16, SADDSUBX, SSUBADDX, UADDSUBX and USUBADDX, that set the GE
flags. For example, the following sequence of instructions sets each byte of Rd
equal to the unsigned minimum of the corresponding bytes of Ra and Rb:

```
  USUB8 Rd, Ra, Rb
  SEL Rd, Rb, Ra
```

Notes

Specifying R15 for register Rd, Rm, or Rn has UNPREDICTABLE results.

## SMLAD


SMLAD (Signed Multiply Accumulate Dual) performs two signed 16 x 16-bit
multiplications. It adds the products to a 32-bit accumulate operand.

Optionally, you can exchange the halfwords of the second operand before
performing the arithmetic. This produces top x bottom and bottom x top
multiplication.

This instruction sets the Q flag if the accumulate operation overflows.
Overflow cannot occur during the multiplications.

X Sets the X bit of the instruction to 1, and the multiplications are bottom x
top and top x bottom.

If the X is omitted, sets the X bit to 0, and the multiplications are bottom x
bottom and top x top.

\<Rm> Specifies the register that contains the first operand.

\<Rs> Specifies the register that contains the second operand.

\<Rn> Specifies the register that contains the accumulate operand.

## Most significant word multiply


There are three signed 32-bit x 32-bit Multiply instructions that produce top
32-bit results:

```
  SMMUL Multiplies the 32-bit values of two registers together, and stores
        the top 32 bits of the signed 64-bit result in a third register.
  SMMLA Multiplies the 32-bit values of two registers together, extracts the
        top 32 bits, adds the 32-bit value from a third register, and stores
        the signed 32-bit result in a fourth register.
  SMMLS Multiplies the 32-bit value of two registers together, extracts the
        top 32 bits, subtracts this from a 32-bit value from a third
        register, and stores the signed 32-bit result in a fourth register.
```

The above three instructions do not affect any flags.


## Dual halfword multiply


There are six dual, signed 16-bit x 16-bit Multiply instructions:

```
  SMUAD Multiplies the values of the top halfwords of two registers together,
        multiplies the values of the bottom halfwords of the same two
        registers together, adds the products, and stores the 32-bit result
        in a third register.
  SMUSD Multiplies the values of the top halfwords of two registers together,
        multiplies the values of the bottom halfwords of the same two
        registers together, subtracts one product from the other, and stores
        the 32-bit result in a third register.
  ---(descriptions below seem to be bugged, seem to describe 32bit SMMxx)---
  SMLAD Multiplies the 32-bit value of two registers together, extracts the
        top 32 bits, subtracts this from a 32-bit value from a third
        register, and stores the signed 32-bit result in a fourth register.
  SMLSD Multiplies the 32-bit values of two registers together, extracts the
        top 32 bits, adds the 32-bit value from a third register, and stores
        the signed 32-bit result in a fourth register.
  SMLALD Multiplies the 32-bit value of two registers together, extracts the
         top 32 bits, subtracts this from a 32-bit value from a third
         register, and stores the signed 32-bit result in a fourth register.
  SMLSLD Multiplies the 32-bit value of two registers together, extracts the
         top 32 bits, subtracts this from a 32-bit value from a third
         register, and stores the signed 32-bit result in a fourth register.
```

SMUAD, SMLAD, and SMLSLD can set the Q flag if overflow occurs in the
operation. All other instructions do not affect any flags.



## Signed/Unsigned Saturate (SSAT, USAT)

## Pack Halfword, Bottom-Top or Top-Bottom (PKHBT, PKHTB)


PKHBT (Pack Halfword Bottom Top) combines the bottom (least significant)
halfword of its first operand with the top (most significant) halfword of its
shifted second operand. The shift is a left shift, by any amount from 0 to 31.

\<Rn> Specifies the register that contains the first operand. Bits[15:0]
of this operand become bits[15:0] of the result of the operation.

\<Rm> Specifies the register that contains the second operand. This is
shifted left by the specified amount, then bits[31:16] of this operand become
bits[31:16] of the result of the operation.

\<shift\_imm> Specifies the amount by which Rm is to be shifted left. This
is a value from 0 to 31.

If the shift specifier is omitted, a left shift by 0 is used.

Operation

if ConditionPassed(cond) then

Rd[15:0] = Rn[15:0]

Rd[31:16] = (Rm Logical\_Shift\_Left shift\_imm)[31:16]

    11-8    Shift applied to Imm   (ROR in steps of two 0-30)
    7-0     Imm - Unsigned 8bit Immediate
    In source code, a 32bit immediate should be specified as operand.
    The assembler should then convert that into a shifted 8bit value.
```

MSR/MRS and CPSR/SPSR supported by ARMv3 and up.

ARMv2 and below contained PSR flags in R15, accessed by CMP/CMN/TST/TEQ{P}.

The field mask bits specify which bits of the destination Psr are write-able
(or write-protected), one or more of these bits should be set, for example,
CPSR\_fsxc (aka CPSR aka CPSR\_all) unlocks all bits (see below user mode
restriction though).

Restrictions:

In non-privileged mode (user mode): only condition code bits of CPSR can be
changed, control bits can't.

Only the SPSR of the current mode can be accessed; In User and System modes no
SPSR exists.

The T-bit may not be changed; for THUMB/ARM switching use BX instruction.

Unused Bits in CPSR are reserved for future use and should never be changed
(except for unused bits in the flags field).

Execution Time: 1S.


Note: The A22i assembler recognizes MOV as alias for both MSR and MRS because
it is practically not possible to remember whether MSR or MRS was the load or
store opcode, and/or whether it does load to or from the Psr register.

## Instruction Formats for \<Address>


An expression which generates an address:

```
  <expression>                  ;an immediate used as address
  ;*** restriction: must be located in range PC+/-4095+8, if so,
  ;*** assembler will calculate offset and use PC (R15) as base.
```

Pre-indexed addressing specification:

```
  [Rn]                          ;offset = zero
  [Rn, <#{+/-}expression>]{!}   ;offset = immediate
  [Rn, {+/-}Rm{,<shift>} ]{!}   ;offset = register shifted by immediate
```

Post-indexed addressing specification:

```
  [Rn], <#{+/-}expression>      ;offset = immediate
  [Rn], {+/-}Rm{,<shift>}       ;offset = register shifted by immediate
```

Whereas...

```
  <shift>  immediate shift such like LSL#4, ROR#2, etc. (see ALU opcodes).
  {!}      exclamation mark ("!") indicates write-back (Rn will be updated).
```



## Notes


Shift amount 0 has special meaning, as described for ALU opcodes.

When writing a word (32bit) to memory, the address should be word-aligned.

When reading a byte from memory, upper 24 bits of Rd are zero-extended.

LDR PC,\<op> on ARMv4 leaves CPSR.T unchanged.

LDR PC,\<op> on ARMv5 sets CPSR.T to
\<op> Bit0, (1=Switch to Thumb).


When reading a word from a halfword-aligned address (which is located in the
middle between two word-aligned addresses), the lower 16bit of Rd will contain
[address] ie. the addressed halfword, and the upper 16bit of Rd will contain
[Rd-2] ie. more or less unwanted garbage. However, by isolating lower bits this
may be used to read a halfword from memory. (Above applies to little endian
mode, as used in GBA.)


In a virtual memory based environment (ie. not in the GBA), aborts (ie. page
faults) may take place during execution, if so, Rm and Rn should not specify
the same register when post-indexing is used, as the abort-handler might have
problems to reconstruct the original value of the register.


Return: CPSR flags are not affected.

Execution Time: For normal LDR: 1S+1N+1I. For LDR PC: 2S+2N+1I. For STR: 2N.



## PLD \<Address> ;Prepare Cache for Load


PLD must use following settings cond=1111b, P=1, B=1, W=0, L=1, Rd=1111b, the
address may not use post-indexing, and may not use writeback, the opcode is
encoded identical as LDRNVB R15,\<Address>.

PLD signalizes to the memory system that a specific memory address will be soon
accessed, the memory system may use this hint to prepare caching/pipelining,
aside from that, PLD does not have any affect to the program logic, and behaves
identical as NOP.

PLD supported by ARMv5TE and up only, not ARMv5, not ARMv5TExP.

```

Return: No Flags affected.

Execution Time: For normal LDM, nS+1N+1I. For LDM PC, (n+1)S+2N+1I. For STM
(n-1)S+2N. Where n is the number of words transferred.



## Addressing Modes {amod}


The IB,IA,DB,DA suffixes directly specify the desired U and P bits:

```
  IB  increment before          ;P=1, U=1
  IA  increment after           ;P=0, U=1
  DB  decrement before          ;P=1, U=0
  DA  decrement after           ;P=0, U=0
```

Alternately, FD,ED,FA,EA could be used, mostly to simplify mnemonics for stack
transfers.

```
  ED  empty stack, descending   ;LDM: P=1, U=1  ;STM: P=0, U=0
  FD  full stack,  descending   ;     P=0, U=1  ;     P=1, U=0
  EA  empty stack, ascending    ;     P=1, U=0  ;     P=0, U=1
  FA  full stack,  ascending    ;     P=0, U=0  ;     P=1, U=1
```

Ie. the following expressions are aliases for each other:

```
  STMFD=STMDB=PUSH   STMED=STMDA   STMFA=STMIB   STMEA=STMIA
  LDMFD=LDMIA=POP    LDMED=LDMIB   LDMFA=LDMDA   LDMEA=LDMDB
```

Note: The equivalent THUMB functions use fixed organization:

```
  PUSH/POP: full descending     ;base register SP (R13)
  LDM/STM:  increment after     ;base register R0..R7
```

Descending is common stack organization as used in 80x86 and Z80 CPUs, SP is
decremented when pushing/storing data, and incremented when popping/loading
data.



## When S Bit is set (S=1)


If instruction is LDM and R15 is in the list: (Mode Changes)

```
  While R15 loaded, additionally: CPSR=SPSR_<current mode>
```

Otherwise: (User bank transfer)

```
  Rlist is referring to User Bank Registers, R0-R15 (rather than
  register related to the current mode, such like R14_svc etc.)
  Base write-back should not be used for User bank transfer.
  Caution - When instruction is LDM:
  If the following instruction reads from a banked register (eg. R14_svc),
  then CPU might still read R14 instead; if necessary insert a dummy NOP.
```



## Notes


The base address should be usually word-aligned.

LDM Rn,...,PC on ARMv4 leaves CPSR.T unchanged.

LDR Rn,...,PC on ARMv5 sets CPSR.T to \<op> Bit0, (1=Switch to Thumb).



## Transfer Order


The lowest Register in Rlist (R0 if its in the list) will be loaded/stored
to/from the lowest memory address.

Internally, the rlist register are always processed with INCREASING addresses
(ie. for DECREASING addressing modes, the CPU does first calculate the lowest
address, and does then process rlist with increasing addresses; this detail can
be important when accessing memory mapped I/O ports).



## Strange Effects on Invalid Rlist's


Empty Rlist: R15 loaded/stored (ARMv4 only), and Rb=Rb+/-40h (ARMv4-v5).

Writeback with Rb included in Rlist: Store OLD base if Rb is FIRST entry in
Rlist, otherwise store NEW base (STM/ARMv4), always store OLD base (STM/ARMv5),
no writeback (LDM/ARMv4), writeback if Rb is "the ONLY register, or NOT the
LAST register" in Rlist (LDM/ARMv5).

SWP/SWPB supported by ARMv2a and up. SWP/SWPB has been deprecated in ARMv6,
made optional in ARMv7 (with the possibility of disabling it if still
available), and removed in ARMv8.

Swap works properly including if Rm and Rn specify the same register.

R15 may not be used for either Rn,Rd,Rm. (Rn=R15 would be MRS opcode).

Upper bits of Rd are zero-expanded when using Byte quantity. For info about
byte and word data memory addressing, read LDR and STR opcode description.

A22i syntax allows to use MOV with Rd specified as first (dest), or last
(source) operand. Native MCR/MRC syntax uses Rd as middle operand, \<cp>
can be ommited if \<cp> is zero.

When using MCR with R15: Coprocessor will receive a data value of PC+12.

When using MRC with R15: Bit 31-28 of data are copied to Bit 31-28 of CPSR (ie.
N,Z,C,V flags), other data bits are ignored, CPSR Bit 27-0 are not affected,
R15 (PC) is not affected.

Execution time: 1S+bI+1C for MCR, 1S+(b+1)I+1C for MRC.

Return: For MRC only: Either R0-R14 modified, or flags affected (see above).

For details refer to original ARM docs. The opcodes are irrelevant for GBA/NDS7
because no coprocessor exists (except for a dummy CP14 unit). However, NDS9
includes a working CP15 unit. And, 3DS ARM11 uses CP10/CP11 as VFP floating

# <a name="thumbopcodesregisteroperationsalubx"></a>THUMB Opcodes: Register Operations (ALU, BX)




## THUMB.1: move shifted register


```
  15-13  Must be 000b for 'move shifted register' instructions
  12-11  Opcode
           00b: LSL{S} Rd,Rs,#Offset   (logical/arithmetic shift left)
           01b: LSR{S} Rd,Rs,#Offset   (logical    shift right)
           10b: ASR{S} Rd,Rs,#Offset   (arithmetic shift right)
           11b: Reserved (used for add/subtract instructions)
  10-6   Offset                     (0-31)
  5-3    Rs - Source register       (R0..R7)
  2-0    Rd - Destination register  (R0..R7)
```

Example: LSL Rd,Rs,#nn ; Rd = Rs \<\< nn ; ARM equivalent: MOVS Rd,Rs,LSL
#nn

Zero shift amount is having special meaning (same as for ARM shifts), LSL#0
performs no shift (the carry flag remains unchanged), LSR/ASR#0 are interpreted
as LSR/ASR#32. Attempts to specify LSR/ASR#0 in source code are automatically
redirected as LSL#0, and source LSR/ASR#32 is redirected as opcode LSR/ASR#0.

Execution Time: 1S

Flags: Z=zeroflag, N=sign, C=carry (except LSL#0: C=unchanged), V=unchanged.



## THUMB.2: add/subtract


```
  15-11  Must be 00011b for 'add/subtract' instructions
  10-9   Opcode (0-3)
           0: ADD{S} Rd,Rs,Rn   ;add register        Rd=Rs+Rn
           1: SUB{S} Rd,Rs,Rn   ;subtract register   Rd=Rs-Rn
           2: ADD{S} Rd,Rs,#nn  ;add immediate       Rd=Rs+nn
           3: SUB{S} Rd,Rs,#nn  ;subtract immediate  Rd=Rs-nn
         Pseudo/alias opcode with Imm=0:
           2: MOV{ADDS} Rd,Rs      ;move (affects cpsr) Rd=Rs+0
  8-6    For Register Operand:
           Rn - Register Operand (R0..R7)
         For Immediate Operand:
           nn - Immediate Value  (0-7)
  5-3    Rs - Source register       (R0..R7)
  2-0    Rd - Destination register  (R0..R7)
```

Return: Rd contains result, N,Z,C,V affected (including MOV).

Execution Time: 1S



## THUMB.3: move/compare/add/subtract immediate


```
  15-13  Must be 001b for this type of instructions
  12-11  Opcode
           00b: MOV{S} Rd,#nn      ;move     Rd   = #nn
           01b: CMP{S} Rd,#nn      ;compare  Void = Rd - #nn
           10b: ADD{S} Rd,#nn      ;add      Rd   = Rd + #nn
           11b: SUB{S} Rd,#nn      ;subtract Rd   = Rd - #nn
  10-8   Rd - Destination Register  (R0..R7)
  7-0    nn - Unsigned Immediate    (0-255)
```

ARM equivalents for MOV/CMP/ADD/SUB are MOVS/CMP/ADDS/SUBS same format.

Execution Time: 1S

Return: Rd contains result (except CMP), N,Z,C,V affected (for MOV only N,Z).



## THUMB.4: ALU operations


```
  15-10  Must be 010000b for this type of instructions
  9-6    Opcode (0-Fh)
           0: AND{S} Rd,Rs     ;AND logical       Rd = Rd AND Rs
           1: EOR{S} Rd,Rs     ;XOR logical       Rd = Rd XOR Rs
           2: LSL{S} Rd,Rs     ;log. shift left   Rd = Rd << (Rs AND 0FFh)
           3: LSR{S} Rd,Rs     ;log. shift right  Rd = Rd >> (Rs AND 0FFh)
           4: ASR{S} Rd,Rs     ;arit shift right  Rd = Rd SAR (Rs AND 0FFh)
           5: ADC{S} Rd,Rs     ;add with carry    Rd = Rd + Rs + Cy
           6: SBC{S} Rd,Rs     ;sub with carry    Rd = Rd - Rs - NOT Cy
           7: ROR{S} Rd,Rs     ;rotate right      Rd = Rd ROR (Rs AND 0FFh)
           8: TST    Rd,Rs     ;test            Void = Rd AND Rs
           9: NEG{S} Rd,Rs     ;negate            Rd = 0 - Rs
           A: CMP    Rd,Rs     ;compare         Void = Rd - Rs
           B: CMN    Rd,Rs     ;neg.compare     Void = Rd + Rs
           C: ORR{S} Rd,Rs     ;OR logical        Rd = Rd OR Rs
           D: MUL{S} Rd,Rs     ;multiply          Rd = Rd * Rs
           E: BIC{S} Rd,Rs     ;bit clear         Rd = Rd AND NOT Rs
           F: MVN{S} Rd,Rs     ;not               Rd = NOT Rs
  5-3    Rs - Source Register       (R0..R7)
  2-0    Rd - Destination Register  (R0..R7)
```

ARM equivalent for NEG would be RSBS.

Return: Rd contains result (except TST,CMP,CMN),

Affected Flags:

```
  N,Z,C,V for  ADC,SBC,NEG,CMP,CMN
  N,Z,C   for  LSL,LSR,ASR,ROR (carry flag unchanged if zero shift amount)
  N,Z,C   for  MUL on ARMv4 and below: carry flag destroyed
  N,Z     for  MUL on ARMv5 and above: carry flag unchanged
  N,Z     for  AND,EOR,TST,ORR,BIC,MVN
```

Execution Time:

```
  1S      for  AND,EOR,ADC,SBC,TST,NEG,CMP,CMN,ORR,BIC,MVN
  1S+1I   for  LSL,LSR,ASR,ROR
  1S+mI   for  MUL on ARMv4 (m=1..4; depending on MSBs of incoming Rd value)
  1S+mI   for  MUL on ARMv5 (m=3; fucking slow, no matter of MSBs of Rd value)
```



## THUMB.5: Hi register operations/branch exchange


```
  15-10  Must be 010001b for this type of instructions
  9-8    Opcode (0-3)
           0: ADD Rd,Rs   ;add        Rd = Rd+Rs
           1: CMP Rd,Rs   ;compare  Void = Rd-Rs  ;CPSR affected
           2: MOV Rd,Rs   ;move       Rd = Rs
           2: NOP         ;nop        R8 = R8
           3: BX  Rs      ;jump       PC = Rs     ;may switch THUMB/ARM
           3: BLX Rs      ;call       PC = Rs     ;may switch THUMB/ARM (ARM9)
  7      MSBd - Destination Register most significant bit (or BL/BLX flag)
  6      MSBs - Source Register most significant bit
  5-3    Rs - Source Register        (together with MSBs: R0..R15)
  2-0    Rd - Destination Register   (together with MSBd: R0..R15)
```

Restrictions: For ADD/CMP/MOV, MSBs and/or MSBd must be set, ie. it is not
allowed that both are cleared.

When using R15 (PC) as operand, the value will be the address of the
instruction plus 4 (ie. $+4). Except for BX R15: CPU switches to ARM state, and
PC is auto-aligned as (($+4) AND NOT 2).

For BX, MSBs may be 0 or 1, MSBd must be zero, Rd is not used/zero.

For BLX, MSBs may be 0 or 1, MSBd must be set, Rd is not used/zero.

For BX/BLX, when Bit 0 of the value in Rs is zero:

```
  Processor will be switched into ARM mode!
  If so, Bit 1 of Rs must be cleared (32bit word aligned).
  Thus, BX PC (switch to ARM) may be issued from word-aligned address
  only, the destination is PC+4 (ie. the following halfword is skipped).
```

BLX may not use R15. BLX saves the return address as LR=PC+3 (with thumb bit).

Using BLX R14 is possible (sets PC=Old\_LR, and New\_LR=retadr).

Assemblers/Disassemblers should use MOV R8,R8 as NOP (in THUMB mode).

Return: Only CMP affects CPSR condition flags!

Execution Time:

```
 1S     for ADD/MOV/CMP
 2S+1N  for ADD/MOV with Rd=R15, and for BX
```




# <a name="thumbopcodesmemoryloadstoreldrstr"></a>THUMB Opcodes: Memory Load/Store (LDR/STR)




## THUMB.6: load PC-relative (for loading immediates from literal pool)

  15-11  Must be 01001b for this type of instructions
  N/A    Opcode (fixed)
           LDR Rd,[PC,#nn]      ;load 32bit    Rd = WORD[PC+nn]
  10-8   Rd - Destination Register   (R0..R7)
  7-0    nn - Unsigned offset        (0-1020 in steps of 4)
```

The value of PC will be interpreted as (($+4) AND NOT 2).

Return: No flags affected, data loaded into Rd.

Execution Time: 1S+1N+1I

          2: LDR  Rd,[Rb,Ro]   ;load  32bit data  Rd = WORD[Rb+Ro]
          3: LDRB Rd,[Rb,Ro]   ;load   8bit data  Rd = BYTE[Rb+Ro]
  9      Must be zero (0) for this type of instructions
  8-6    Ro - Offset Register              (R0..R7)
  5-3    Rb - Base Register                (R0..R7)
  2-0    Rd - Source/Destination Register  (R0..R7)
```

# <a name="thumbopcodesmemorymultipleloadstorepushpopandldmstm"></a>THUMB Opcodes: Memory Multiple Load/Store (PUSH/POP and LDM/STM)




## THUMB.14: push/pop registers


```
  15-12  Must be 1011b for this type of instructions
  11     Opcode (0-1)
          0: PUSH {Rlist}{LR}   ;store in memory, decrements SP (R13)
          1: POP  {Rlist}{PC}   ;load from memory, increments SP (R13)
  10-9   Must be 10b for this type of instructions
  8      PC/LR Bit (0-1)
          0: No
          1: PUSH LR (R14), or POP PC (R15)
  7-0    Rlist - List of Registers (R7..R0)
```

In THUMB mode stack is always meant to be 'full descending', ie. PUSH is
equivalent to 'STMFD/STMDB' and POP to 'LDMFD/LDMIA' in ARM mode.

Examples:

```
 PUSH {R0-R3}     ;push R0,R1,R2,R3
 PUSH {R0,R2,LR}  ;push R0,R2,LR
 POP  {R4,R7}     ;pop R4,R7
 POP  {R2-R4,PC}  ;pop R2,R3,R4,PC
```

Note: When calling to a sub-routine, the return address is stored in LR
register, when calling further sub-routines, PUSH {LR} must be used to save
higher return address on stack. If so, POP {PC} can be later used to return
from the sub-routine.

POP {PC} ignores the least significant bit of the return address (processor
remains in thumb state even if bit0 was cleared), when intending to return with
optional mode switch, use a POP/BX combination (eg. POP {R3} / BX R3).

ARM9: POP {PC} copies the LSB to thumb bit (switches to ARM if bit0=0).

Return: No flags affected, SP adjusted, registers loaded/stored.

Execution Time: nS+1N+1I (POP), (n+1)S+2N+1I (POP PC), or (n-1)S+2N (PUSH).



## THUMB.15: multiple load/store


```
  15-12  Must be 1100b for this type of instructions
  11     Opcode (0-1)
          0: STMIA Rb!,{Rlist}   ;store in memory, increments Rb
          1: LDMIA Rb!,{Rlist}   ;load from memory, increments Rb
  10-8   Rb - Base register (modified) (R0-R7)
  7-0    Rlist - List of Registers     (R7..R0)
```

Both STM and LDM are incrementing the Base Register.

The lowest register in the list (ie. R0, if it's in the list) is stored/loaded
at the lowest memory address.

Examples:

```
 STMIA R7!,{R0-R2}  ;store R0,R1,R2
 LDMIA R0!,{R1,R5}  ;store R1,R5
```

Return: No flags affected, Rb adjusted, registers loaded/stored.

Execution Time: nS+1N+1I for LDM, or (n-1)S+2N for STM.



## Strange Effects on Invalid Rlist's


Empty Rlist: R15 loaded/stored (ARMv4 only), and Rb=Rb+40h (ARMv4-v5).

Writeback with Rb included in Rlist: Store OLD base if Rb is FIRST entry in
Rlist, otherwise store NEW base (STM/ARMv4), always store OLD base (STM/ARMv5),
no writeback (LDM/ARMv4/ARMv5; at this point, THUMB opcodes work different than
ARM opcodes).

## THUMB.16: conditional branch


```
  15-12  Must be 1101b for this type of instructions

          5: BPL label        ;N=0         ;signed  positive or zero (plus)
          6: BVS label        ;V=1         ;signed  overflow (V set)
          7: BVC label        ;V=0         ;signed  no overflow (V cleared)
          8: BHI label        ;C=1 and Z=0 ;unsigned higher
          9: BLS label        ;C=0 or Z=1  ;unsigned lower or same
          A: BGE label        ;N=V         ;signed greater or equal

          C: BGT label        ;Z=0 and N=V ;signed greater than
          D: BLE label        ;Z=1 or N<>V ;signed less or equal
          E: Undefined, should not be used
          F: Reserved for SWI instruction (see SWI opcode)
  7-0    Signed Offset, step 2 ($+4-256..$+4+254)
```

Destination address must by halfword aligned (ie. bit 0 cleared)

Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted if condition true

Execution Time:

```
  2S+1N   if condition true (jump executed)
  1S      if condition false
```



## BX and ADD/MOV PC

  N/A    Opcode (fixed)
          B label   ;branch (jump)
  10-0   Signed Offset, step 2 ($+4-2048..$+4+2046)
```

Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted.

Execution Time: 2S+1N



## THUMB.19: long branch with link


This may be used to call (or jump) to a subroutine, return address is saved in
LR (R14).

Unlike all other THUMB mode instructions, this instruction occupies 32bit of
memory which are split into two 16bit THUMB opcodes.

- First Instruction - LR = PC+4+(nn SHL 12)
  - 15-11  Must be 11110b for BL/BLX type of instructions
  - 10-0   nn - Upper 11 bits of Target Address
- Second Instruction - PC = LR + (nn SHL 1), and LR = PC+2 OR 1 (and BLX: T=0)
  - 15-11  Opcode
                  - 11111b: BL label   ;branch long with link
                  - 11101b: BLX label  ;branch long with link switch to ARM mode (ARM9)
  - 10-0   nn - Lower 11 bits of Target Address (BLX: Bit0 Must be zero)

The destination address range is (PC+4)-400000h..+3FFFFEh, ie. PC+/-4M.

Target must be halfword-aligned. As Bit 0 in LR is set, it may be used to
return by a BX LR instruction (keeping CPU in THUMB mode).

Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted, return address in LR.

Execution Time: 3S+1N (first opcode 1S, second opcode 2S+1N).

Note: Exceptions may or may not occur between first and second opcode, this is
"implementation defined" (unknown how this is implemented in GBA and NDS).

Using only the 2nd half of BL as "BL LR+imm" is possible (for example, Mario
Golf Advance Tour for GBA uses opcode F800h as "BL LR+0").



## THUMB.17: software interrupt and breakpoint


SWI supposed for calls to the operating system - Enter Supervisor mode (SVC) in
ARM state. BKPT intended for debugging - enters Abort mode in ARM state via
Prefetch Abort vector.

```
  15-8   Opcode
          11011111b: SWI nn   ;software interrupt
          10111110b: BKPT nn  ;software breakpoint (ARMv5 and up)
  7-0    nn - Comment Field, ignored by processor (8bit value) (0-255)
```

Execution Time: 2S+1N

The exception handler may interprete the SWI Comment Field by examining the
lower 8bit of the 16bit opcode opcode at [R14\_svc-2].

If your are also using SWI's from inside of ARM mode, then the SWI handler must
examine the T Bit SPSR\_svc in order to determine whether it's been a ARM SWI -
and if so, examine the lower 24bit of the 32bit opcode opcode at [R14\_svc-4].

For Returning from SWI use "MOVS PC,R14", that instruction does restore both PC
and CPSR, ie. PC=R14\_svc, and CPSR=SPSR\_svc, and (as called from THUMB mode),
it'll also restore THUMB mode.

Nesting SWIs: SPSR\_svc and R14\_svc should be saved on stack before either
invoking nested SWIs, or (if the IRQ handler uses SWIs) before enabling IRQs.

Execution SWI/BKPT:

```
  R14_svc=PC+2     R14_abt=PC+4   ;save return address
  SPSR_svc=CPSR    SPSR_abt=CPSR  ;save CPSR flags
  CPSR=<changed>   CPSR=<changed> ;Enter svc/abt, ARM state, IRQs disabled
  PC=VVVV0008h     PC=VVVV000Ch   ;jump to SWI/PrefetchAbort vector address
```

  7      MSB of Rd
  6      MSB of Rm
  5-3    Rm Source Register
  2-0    Rd Destination Register
```

Move without changing flags. It's called CPY because THUMB syntax didn't
distinguish between MOV and MOVS (until UAL syntax was invented, which makes
the name CPY irrelevant).

CPY is officially supported in "T variants of ARMv6 and above" (in practice, it
should work on ARMv4T and up, but wasn't officially documented until ARMv6).

  Type          Normal       Alias
  Decimal       85           #85  &d85
  Hexadecimal   55h          #55h  0x55  #0x55  $55  &h55
  Octal         125o         0o125  &o125
  Ascii         'U'          "U"
  Binary        01010101b    %01010101  0b01010101  &b01010101
  Roman         &rLXXXV      (very useful for arrays of kings and chapters)
```

Note: The default numeric format can be changed by the .radix directive
(usually 10=decimal). For example, with radix 16, values like "85" and "0101b"
are treated as hexadecimal numbers (in that case, decimal and binary numbers
can be still defined with prefixes &d and &b).



## A22i Numeric Operators Priority


```
  Prio  Operator           Aliases
  8     (,) brackets
  7     +,- sign
  6     *,/,MOD,SHL,SHR    MUL,DIV,<<,>>
  5     +,- operation
  4     EQ,GE,GT,LE,LT,NE  =,>=,>,<=,<,<>,==,!=
  3     NOT
  2     AND
  1     OR,XOR             EOR
```

Operators of same priority are processed from left to right.

Boolean operators (priority 4) return 1=TRUE, 0=FALSE.



## A22i Nocash Syntax


Even though A22i does recognize the official ARM syntax, it's also allowing to
use friendly code:

```
  mov   r0,0ffh         ;no C64-style "#", and no C-style "0x" required
  stmia [r7]!,r0,r4-r5  ;square [base] brackets, no fancy {rlist} brackets
  mov   r0,cpsr         ;no confusing MSR and MRS (whatever which is which)
  mov   r0,p0,0,c0,c0,0 ;no confusing MCR and MRC (whatever which is which)
  ldr   r0,[score]      ;allows to use clean brackets for relative addresses
  push  rlist           ;alias for stmfd [r13]!,rlist (and same for pop/ldmfd)
  label:                ;label definitions recommended to use ":" colons
```


[A22i is the no$gba debug version's built-in source code assembler.]




# <a name="armcp14icebreakerdebugcommunicationschannel"></a>ARM CP14 ICEbreaker Debug Communications Channel



The ICEbreaker aka EmbeddedICE module may be found in ARM7TDMI and possibly
also in other ARM processors. The main functionality of the module relies on
external inputs (BREAKPT signal, etc.) being controlled by external debugging
hardware. At software side, ICEbreaker contains a Debug Communications Channel
(again to access external hardware), which can be accessed as coprocessor 14
via following opcodes:

```
  MRC{cond} P14,0,Rd,C0,C0,0  ;Read Debug Comms Control Register
  MRC{cond} P14,0,Rd,C1,C0,0  ;Read Debug Comms Data Register
  MRC{cond} P14,0,Rd,C2,C0,0  ;Read Debug Comms Status Register
  MCR{cond} P14,0,Rd,C1,C0,0  ;Write Debug Comms Data Register
  MCR{cond} P14,0,Rd,C2,C0,0  ;Write Debug Comms Status Register
```

The Control register consists of Bit31-28=ICEbreaker version (0001b for
ARM7TDMI), Bit27-2=Not specified, Bit0/Bit1=Data Read/Write Status Flags.


The NDS7 and GBA allow to access CP14 (unlike as for CP0..CP13 & CP15,
access to CP14 doesn't generate any exceptions), however, the ICEbreaker module
appears to be disabled (or completely unimplemented), any reads from
P14,0,Rd,C0,C0,0 through P14,7,Rd,C15,C15,7 are simply returning the prefetched
opcode value from [$+8]. ICEbreaker might be eventually used and enabled in
Nintendo's hardware debuggers, although external breakpoints are reportedly
implemented via /FIQ input rather than via ICEbreaker hardware.

The NDS9 doesn't include a CP14 unit (or it is fully disabled), any attempts to
access it are causing invalid instruction exceptions.

# <a name="armcp15overview"></a>ARM CP15 Overview




## CP15


In many ARM CPUs, particulary such with memory control facilities, coprocessor
number 15 (CP15) is used as built-in System Control Coprocessor.

CPUs without memory control functions typically don't include a CP15 at all, in
that case even an attempt to read the Main ID register will cause an Undefined
Instruction exception.



## CP15 Opcodes


CP15 can be accessed via MCR and MRC opcodes, with Pn=P15, and \<cpopc>=0.

```
  MCR{cond} P15,<cpopc>,Rd,Cn,Cm,<cp>   ;move from ARM to CP15
  MRC{cond} P15,<cpopc>,Rd,Cn,Cm,<cp>   ;move from CP15 to ARM
```

Rd can be any ARM register in range R0-R14, R15 should not be used with P15.

\<cpopc>,Cn,Cm,\<cp> are used to select a CP15 register, eg.
0,C0,C0,0 = Main ID Register.

Other coprocessor opcodes (CDP, LDC, STC) cannot be used with P15.

## Data/Unified Registers


Some Cache/PU/TCM registers are declared as "Data/Unified".

That registers are used for Data accesses in case that the CPU contains
separate Data and Instruction registers, otherwise the registers are used for
both (unified) Data and Instruction accesses.

```

Note: On the NDS9, this register is 41059461h (ARMv5TE, ARM946, rev1). NDS7 and
GBA don't have CP15s.



## C0,C0,1 - Cache Type Register (R)

The 12bit Instruction/Data values are decoded as shown below,

```
  Cache Absent  = (ASSOC=0 and M=1)       ;in that case overriding below
  Cache Size    = 200h+(100h*M) shl SIZE  ;min 0.5Kbytes, max 96Kbytes

  Line Length   = 8 shl LEN               ;min 8 bytes,   max 64 bytes
```

For Unified cache (Bit 24=0), Instruction and Data values are identical.

Note: On the NDS9, this register is 0F0D2112h (Code=2000h bytes, Data=1000h
bytes, assoc=whatever, and line size 32 bytes each). NDS7 and GBA don't have

Various bits in this register may be read-only (fixed 0 if unsupported, or
fixed 1 if always activated).

On NDS ARM9, bit0,2,7,12..19 are R/W, bit3..6 are always set, all other bits

are always set, all other bits are always zero.




# <a name="armcp15memorymanagmentunitmmu"></a>ARM CP15 Memory Managment Unit (MMU)



Nintendo consoles have a MMU on the ARM11 processor (in 3DS).


The MMU allows to assign virtual memory addresses, and to disable the data
cache in sensitive memory areas (eg. I/O area, and memory that is shared for
ARM9/ARM11). Additionally, it can trigger page fault exceptions (eg. for error
handling or memory mapped files).

This is an older format, similar to the newer ARMv6 tables, but without the

## Supersections and Large Pages


16Mbyte Supersections and 64Kbyte Large pages consist of 16 identical table
entries. Which is basically same as 16 Sections or 16 Pages with continously
increasing entries.

The advantage is internal caching: If one table entry is cached, then the
hardware knows that the other 15 nearby entries are supposed to be same; and
that they won't need to be loaded into internal cache.

## C3,C0,0 - Cache Write-Bufferability Bits for Data Protection Regions (R/W)


Allows to select what to do when writing to a cached memory snippet:

Write-Through stores the data in the cache line (so subsequent cache reads
return correct data), and additionally writes the data to underlaying memory.

Write-Back stores the data in the cache line only, and marks the line as dirty,
but doesn't update the underlaying memory (underlaying memory is updated only
when the CPU decides to use the cache line for other purposes, or when the user
is manually "Cleaning" the cache line).

```
  0-7  Bufferable (B) bits for region 0-7  (0=Write-Through, 1=Write-Back)
  8-31 Reserved/zero
```

Instruction fetches are, obviously, always read-operations. So, there are no
write-bufferability bits for Instruction Protection Regions.

Note: Unrelated to the "Cache Write-Bufferability", the ARM does also have a
"Write Buffer" (a small FIFO that can queue only a few writes).

## C5,C0,3 - Extended Access Permission Instruction Protection Region (if any) (R/W)


For C5,C0,0 and C5,C0,1:

```
  0-15  Access Permission (AP) bits for region 0-7 (Bits 0-1=AP0, 2-3=AP1, etc)
  16-31 Reserved/zero
```

For C5,C0,2 and C5,C0,3 (Extended):

## C6,C0..C7,0 - Protection Unit Data/Unified Region 0..7 (R/W)



## C6,C0..C7,1 - Protection Unit Instruction Region 0..7 (R/W) if any


```
  0     Protection Region Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)
  1-5   Protection Region Size   (2 SHL X) ;min=(X=11)=4KB, max=(X=31)=4GB
  6-11  Reserved/zero
  12-31 Protection Region Base address (Addr = Y*4K; must be SIZE-aligned)
```

Overlapping Regions are allowed, Region 7 is having highest priority, region 0
lowest priority.



## Background Region


Additionally, any memory areas outside of the eight Protection Regions are
handled as Background Region, this region has neither Read nor Write access.



## Unified Region Note


On the NDS, the Region registers are unified (C6,C0..C7,1 are read/write-able
mirrors of C6,C0..C7,0). Nethertheless, the Cachabilty and Permission registers
are NOT unified (separate registers exists for code and data settings).




# <a name="armcp15cachecontrol"></a>ARM CP15 Cache Control



Cache is enabled/controlled by Bit 2,3,12,14 in Control Register.

Cache regions are controlled via Protection Unit (PU).

Cache type can be detected via Cache Type Register.

  (Clean is important when having "Cache Write-Bufferability" enabled in PU)
```



## C9,C0,0 - Data Cache Lockdown



## C9,C0,1 - Instruction Cache Lockdown


(Width (W) of index field depends on cache ASSOCIATIVETY.)

Format A:

```
  0..(31-W)  Reserved/zero
  (32-W)..31 Lockdown Block Index
```

Format B:

```
  0..(W-1)   Lockdown Block Index
  W..30      Reserved/zero
  31         L
```


Cache/Write-buffer should not be enabled for the whole 4GB memory area,
high-speed TCM memory doesn't require caching, and caching would have fatal
results on I/O ports. So, cache can be used only in combination with the
Protection Unit, which allows to enable/disable caching in specified regions.



## Note


ARMv5 instruction set supports a Cache Prepare for Load opcode (PLD), see

- [ARM Opcodes: Memory: Single Data Transfer (LDR, STR, PLD)](#armopcodesmemorysingledatatransferldrstrpld)


## Note


Data cache always requires PU/MMU. Code cache requires PU/MMU on ARM9, but also
works without PU/MMU on ARM11.




# <a name="armcp15tightlycoupledmemorytcm"></a>ARM CP15 Tightly Coupled Memory (TCM)



TCM is high-speed memory, directly contained in the ARM CPU core.



## TCM and DMA


TCM doesn't use the ARM bus. A minor disadvantage is that TCM cannot be
accessed by DMA. However, the main advantage is that, when using TCM, the CPU
can be kept running without any waitstates even while the bus is used for DMA
transfers. Operation during DMA works only if all code/data is located in TCM,
waitstates are generated if any code/data outside TCM is accessed; in worst
case (if there are no gaps in the DMA) then the CPU is halted until the DMA
finishes.



## TCM and DMA and IRQ


No idea if/how IRQs are handled during DMA? Eventually (unlikely) code in TCM
is kept executed until DMA finishes (ie. until the IRQ vector can be accessed.
Eventually the IRQ vector is instantly accessed (causing to halt the CPU until
DMA finishes). In both cases: Assuming that IRQs are enabled, and that the IRQ
vector and/or IRQ handler are located outside TCM.



## Separate Instruction (ITCM) and Data (DTCM) Memory


DTCM can be used only for Data accesses, typically used for stacks and other
frequently accessed data.

ITCM is primarily intended for instruction accesses, but it can be also used
for Data accesses (among others allowing to copy code to ITCM), however,
performance isn't optimal when simultaneously accessing ITCM for code and data
(such like opcodes in ITCM that use literal pool values in ITCM).



## TCM Enable, TCM Load Mode


CP15 Control Register allows to enable ITCM and DTCM, and to switch ITCM/DTCM
into Load Mode. In Load Mode (when TCM is enabled), TCM becomes write-only;
this allows to read data from source addresses in main memory, and to write
data to destination addresses in TCM by using the same addresses; useful for
initializing TCM with overlapping source/dest addresses; Load mode works with
all Load/Store opcodes, it does NOT work with SWP/SWPB opcodes.


TCM Physical Size can be detected in 3rd ID Code Register. (C0,C0,2)



## C9,C1,0 - Data TCM Size/Base (R/W)



## C9,C1,1 - Instruction TCM Size/Base (R/W)


```
  0     Reserved     (0)
  1-5   Virtual Size (Size = 512 SHL N) ;min=(N=3)=4KB, max=(N=23)=4GB
  6-11  Reserved     (0)
  12-31 Region Base  (Base = X SHL 12)  ;Base must be Size-aligned
```

The Virtual size settings should be normally same as the Physical sizes (see
C0,C0,2). However, smaller sizes are allowed (using only the 1st some KB), as
well as bigger sizes (TCM area is then filled with mirrors of physical TCM).

The ITCM region base may be fixed (read-only), for example, on the NDS, ITCM
base is always 00000000h, nethertheless the virtual size may be changed
(allowing to mirror ITCM to higher addresses).

If DTCM and ITCM do overlap, then ITCM appears to have priority.



## TCM and PU


TCM can be used without Protection Unit.

When the protection unit is enabled, TCM is controlled by the PU just like
normal memory, the PU should provide R/W Access Permission for TCM regions;
cache and write-buffer are not required for high-speed TCM (so both should be
disabled for TCM regions).




# <a name="armcp15misc"></a>ARM CP15 Misc




## C13,C0,0 - Process ID for Fast Context Switch Extension (FCSE) (R/W)


```
  0-24  Reserved/zero
  25-31 Process ID (PID) (0-127) (0=Disable)
```

The FCSE allows different processes (each assembled with ORG 0) to be located
at virtual addresses in the 1st 32MB area. The FCSE splits the total 4GB
address space into blocks of 32MB, accesses to Block(0) are redirected to
Block(PID):

```
  IF addr<32M then addr=addr+PID*32M
  Respectively, with PID=0, the address remains unchanged (FCSE disabled).
```

The CPU-to-Memory address handling is shown below:

```
  1. CPU outputs a virtual address (VA)
  2. FCSE adjusts the VA to a modified virtual address (MVA)
  3. Cache hits determined by examining the MVA, continue below if no hit
  4. MMU translates MVA to physical address (PA) (if no MMU present: PA=MVA)
  5. Memory access occurs at PA
```

The FCSE allows limited virtual addressing even if no MMU is present.

If the MMU is present, then either the FCSE and/or the MMU can be used for
virtual addressing; the advantage of using the FCSE (a single write to
C13,C0,0) is less overload; using the MMU for the same purpose would require to
change virtual address translation table in memory, and to flush the cache.

The NDS doesn't have a FCSE (the FCSE register is read-only, always zero).



## C13,C0,1 - Trace Process ID (R/W)



## C13,C1,1 - Trace Process ID (Mirror) (R/W)


This value is output to ETMPROCID pins (if any), allowing to notify external
hardware about the currently executed process within multi-tasking programs.

```
  0-31  Process ID
```

C13,C1,1 is a mirror of C13,C0,1 (for compatibility with other ARM processors).

Both registers are read/write-able on NDS9, but there are no external pin-outs.



## \<cpopc>


Unlike for all other CP15 registers, the \<cpopc> operand of the MRC/MCR
opcodes isn't always zero for below registers, so below registers are using
"cpopc,Cn,Cm,op2" notation (instead of the normal "Cn,Cm,op2" notation).



## Built-In-Self-Test (BIST)


Allows to test internal memory (ie. TCM, Cache Memory, and Cache TAGs). The
tests are filling (and verifying) the selected memory region thrice (once with
the fillvalue, then with the inverted fillvalue, and then again with the
fillvalue). The BIST functions are intended for diagnostics purposes only, not
for use in normal program code (ARM doesn't guarantee future processors to have
backwards compatible BIST functions).



## 0,C15,C0,1 - BIST TAG Control Register (R/W)



## 1,C15,C0,1 - BIST TCM Control Register (R/W)



## 2,C15,C0,1 - BIST Cache Control Register (R/W)


```
  0-15  Data Control (see below)
  16-31 Instruction Control (see below)
```

The above 16bit control values are:

```
  0     Start bit     (Write: 1=Start) (Read: 1=Busy)
  1     Pause bit     (1=Pause)
  2     Enable bit    (1=Enable)
  3     Fail Flag     (1=Error) (Read Only)
  4     Complete Flag (1=Ready) (Read Only)
  5-15  Size (2^(N+2) bytes) (min=N=1=8bytes, max=N=24=64MB)
```

Size and Pause are not supported in all implementations.

Caution: While and as long as the Enable bit is set, the corresponding memory
region(s) will be disabled. Eg. when testing \<either> DTCM \<and/or>
ITCM, \<both> DTCM \<and> ITCM are forcefully disabled in C1,C0,0
(Control Register), after the test the software must first clear the BIST
enable bit, and then restore DTCM/ITCM bits in C1,C0,0. And of course, the
content of the tested memory region must be restored when needed.



## 0,C15,C0,2 - BIST Instruction TAG Address (R/W)



## 1,C15,C0,2 - BIST Instruction TCM Address (R/W)

## 2,C15,C0,6 - BIST Data Cache Address (R/W)


```
  0-31  Word-aligned Destination Address within Memory Block (eg. within ITCM)
```

On the NDS9, bit0-1, and bit21-31 are always zero.



## 0,C15,C0,3 - BIST Instruction TAG Fillvalue (R/W)



## 1,C15,C0,3 - BIST Instruction TCM Fillvalue (R/W)



## 2,C15,C0,3 - BIST Instruction Cache Fillvalue (R/W)

## 1,C15,C0,7 - BIST Data TCM Fillvalue (R/W)



## 2,C15,C0,7 - BIST Data Cache Fillvalue (R/W)


```
  0-31  Fillvalue for BIST
```

After BIST, the selected memory region is filled by that value. That is, on the
NDS9 at least, all words will be filled with the SAME value (ie. NOT with
increasing or randomly generated numbers).

ARM11:

```
  Observe that Branch Prediction (enabled in CP15 Control register) can affect
  timings for conditional jumps (and presumably non-conditional ones, too).
  Without prediction: A waitloop made of "SUBS+BNE" takes 4 clks per loop cycle
  With prediction: A waitloop made of "SUBS+BNE" takes 2.5 clks per loop cycle
  (apparently the prediction assumes 75% of the jumps to be taken)
```


Whereas,

```
  n = number of words transferred
  b = number of cycles spent in coprocessor busy-wait loop
  m = depends on most significant byte(s) of multiplier operand
```

Above 'trap' is meant to be the execution time for exceptions. And '{cond}
false' is meant to be the execution time for conditional instructions which
haven't been actually executed because the condition has been false.


The separate meaning of the N,S,I,C cycles is:



## N - Non-sequential cycle


Requests a transfer to/from an address which is NOT related to the address used
in the previous cycle. (Called 1st Access in GBA language).

The execution time for 1N is 1 clock cycle (plus non-sequential access
waitstates).



## S - Sequential cycle


Requests a transfer to/from an address which is located directly after the
address used in the previous cycle. Ie. for 16bit or 32bit accesses at
incrementing addresses, the first access is Non-sequential, the following
accesses are sequential. (Called 2nd Access in GBA language).

The execution time for 1S is 1 clock cycle (plus sequential access waitstates).



## I - Internal Cycle


CPU is just too busy, not even requesting a memory transfer for now.

The execution time for 1I is 1 clock cycle (without any waitstates).



## C - Coprocessor Cycle


The CPU uses the data bus to communicate with the coprocessor (if any), but no
memory transfers are requested.



## Memory Waitstates


Ideally, memory may be accessed free of waitstates (1N and 1S are then equal to
1 clock cycle each). However, a memory system may generate waitstates for
several reasons: The memory may be just too slow. Memory is currently accessed
by DMA, eg. sound, video, memory transfers, etc. Or when data is squeezed
through a 16bit data bus (in that special case, 32bit access may have more
waitstates than 8bit and 16bit accesses). Also, the memory system may separate
between S and N cycles (if so, S cycles would be typically faster than N
cycles).



## Memory Waitstates for Different Memory Areas


Different memory areas (eg. ROM and RAM) may have different waitstates. When
executing code in one area which accesses data in another area, then the S+N
cycles must be split into code and data accesses: 1N is used for data access,
plus (n-1)S for LDM/STM, the remaining S+N are code access. If an instruction
jumps to a different memory area, then all code cycles for that opcode are
having waitstate characteristics of the NEW memory area (except Thumb BL which
still executes 1S in OLD area).




# <a name="armcpuversions"></a>ARM CPU Versions




## Version Numbers


ARM CPUs are distributed by name ARM#, and are described as ARMv# in
specifications, whereas "#" is NOT the same than "v#", for example, ARM7TDMI is
ARMv4TM. That is so confusing, that ARM didn't even attempt to clarify the
relationship between the various "#" and "v#" values.



## Version Variants


Suffixes like "M" (long multiply), "T" (Thumb support), "E" (Enhanced DSP)
indicate presence of special features, additionally to the standard instruction
set of a given version, or, when preceded by an "x", indicate the absence of
that features.



## ARMv1 aka ARM1


Some sort of a beta version, according to ARM never been used in any commercial
products.



## ARMv2 and up


MUL,MLA

CDP,LDC,MCR,MRC,STC

SWP/SWPB (ARMv2a and up only)

Two new FIQ registers



## ARMv3 and up


MRS,MSR opcodes (instead CMP/CMN/TST/TEQ{P} opcodes)

CPSR,SPSR registers (instead PSR bits in R15)

Removed never condition, cond=NV no longer valid

32bit addressing (instead 26bit addressing in older versions)

26bit addressing backwards comptibility mode (except v3G)

Abt and Und modes (instead handling aborts/undefined in Svc mode)

BKPT,BLX,CLZ (BKPT,BLX also in THUMB mode)

LDM/LDR/POP PC with mode switch (POP PC also in THUMB mode)

CDP2,LDC2,MCR2,MRC2,STC2 (new coprocessor opcodes)

LDRD,STRD,PLD,MCRR,MRRC (v5TE only, not v5, not v5TExP)

BXJ (jump to Jazelle bytecode) (v5TEJ only)



## ARMv6 aka ARM11 and up (see ARM DDI 0100I)


Supports all ARMv5TEJ features (=including Jazelle?).

The following ARM instructions are added:

- CPS, SRS and RFE instructions for improved exception handling

- REV, REV16 and REVSH byte reversal instructions

- SETEND for a revised endian (memory) model

- LDREX and STREX exclusive access instructions

- SXTB, SXTH, UXTB, UXTH byte/halfword extend instructions

- A set of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) media instructions

- Additional forms of multiply with accumulation into a 64-bit result

The following Thumb instructions are added:

- CPS, CPY (a form of MOV), REV, REV16, REVSH, SETEND, SXTB, SXTH, UXTB, UXTH

SWP/SWPB has been deprecated in ARMv6, made optional in ARMv7 (with the
possibility of disabling it if still available), and removed in ARMv8.



## ARMv6K aka "ARM11 MPCore" (see ARM DDI 0360F) (used in 3DS)


Unknown how this is abbreviated (ARMv6-M would be something else: Cortex-M).

The MPCore processor provides support for extensions to ARMv6 that include:

- LDREX/STREX{B|H|D} for 8bit/16bit/64bit and CLREX

- HINT (TrueNOP, YIELD, WFI, WFE, SEV)

- Architectural remap registers.

- Revised use of TEX remap bits. The ARMv6 MMU page table descriptors use a
large number of bits to describe all of the options for inner and outer
cachability. In reality, no application requires all of these options
simultaneously. Therefore it is possible to use the TEX remap mechanism to
configure the MP11 CPUs to support only a small number of options. This implies
a level of indirection in the page table mappings.

The TEX CB encoding table provides two OS managed page table bits. For binary
compatibility with existing ARMv6 ports of OSs, this gives a separate mode of
operation of the MMU. This is called the TEX Remap configuration and is
controlled by bit [28] TR in CP15 Register 1.

- Revised use of AP bits. In the MP11 CPUs the APX and AP[1:0] encoding b111 is
Privileged or User mode read-only access. AP[0] indicates an abort type, Access
Bit fault, when CP15 c1[29] is 1.

For more information see the ARM Architecture Reference Manual.



## ARMv6T2 aka THUMB-2


This doesn't seem to be supported in 3DS. THUMB-2 adds more 2x16bit opcodes in
THUMB mode, ie. THUMB code can contain classic 16bit opcodes, mixed with new
2x16bit opcodes. As far as I understand, the old 2x16bit "BL" and "BLX" do no
longer exists, or are replaced by differently encode THUMB-2 opcodes?



## ARMv6Z


ARMv6K with Security Extensions. Aka TrustZone, see Processor Feature Register
1.



## A Milestone in Computer History


Original ARMv2 has been used in the relative rare and expensive Archimedes
deluxe home computers in the late eighties, the Archimedes has caught a lot of
attention, particularly for being the first home computer that used a BIOS
being programmed in BASIC language - which has been a absolutely revolutionary
decadency at that time.

Inspired, programmers all over the world have successfully developed even
slower and much more inefficient programming languages, which are nowadays
consequently used by nearly all ARM programmers, and by most non-ARM
programmers as well.

# <a name="biosfunctions"></a>BIOS Functions



The BIOS includes several System Call Functions which can be accessed by SWI
instructions. Incoming parameters are usually passed through registers
R0,R1,R2,R3. Outgoing registers R0,R1,R3 are typically containing either
garbage, or return value(s). All other registers (R2,R4-R14) are kept
unchanged.



## Caution


When invoking SWIs from inside of ARM state specify SWI NN\*10000h, instead of
SWI NN as in THUMB state.

## How BIOS Processes SWIs


SWIs can be called from both within THUMB and ARM mode. In ARM mode, only the
upper 8bit of the 24bit comment field are interpreted.

Each time when calling a BIOS function 4 words (SPSR, R11, R12, R14) are saved
on Supervisor stack (\_svc). Once it has saved that data, the SWI handler
switches into System mode, so that all further stack operations are using user
stack.

In some cases the BIOS may allow interrupts to be executed from inside of the
SWI procedure. If so, and if the interrupt handler calls further SWIs, then
care should be taken that the Supervisor Stack does not overflow.

# <a name="biosdifferencesbetweengbaandndsfunctions"></a>BIOS Differences between GBA and NDS functions




## Differences between GBA and NDS BIOS functions


- SoftReset uses different addresses

- SWI numbers for Halt, Stop/Sleep, Div, Sqrt have changed

- Halt destroys r0 on NDS9, IntrWait bugged on NDS9

- CpuFastSet allows 4-byte blocks (nice), but...

- CpuFastSet works very SLOW because of a programming bug (uncool)

- Some of the decompression functions are now using callbacks

- SoundBias uses new delay parameter

And, a number of GBA functions have been removed, and some new NDS functions
have been added, see:

- [BIOS Function Summary](#biosfunctionsummary)



# <a name="biosarithmeticfunctions"></a>BIOS Arithmetic Functions



Div

DivArm

Sqrt

ArcTan

ArcTan2



## SWI 06h (GBA) or SWI 09h (NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - Div


Signed Division, r0/r1.

```
  r0  signed 32bit Number
  r1  signed 32bit Denom
```

Return:

```
  r0  Number DIV Denom ;signed
  r1  Number MOD Denom ;signed
  r3  ABS (Number DIV Denom) ;unsigned
```

For example, incoming -1234, 10 should return -123, -4, +123.

The function usually gets caught in an endless loop upon division by zero.

Note: The NDS9 and DSi9 additionally support hardware division, by math
coprocessor, accessed via I/O Ports, however, the SWI function is a raw
software division.



## SWI 07h (GBA) - DivArm


Same as above (SWI 06h Div), but incoming parameters are exchanged, r1/r0
(r0=Denom, r1=number). For compatibility with ARM's library. Slightly slower (3
clock cycles) than SWI 06h.



## SWI 08h (GBA) or SWI 0Dh (NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - Sqrt


Calculate square root.

```
  r0   unsigned 32bit number
```

Return:

```
  r0   unsigned 16bit number
```

The result is an integer value, so Sqrt(2) would return 1, to avoid this
inaccuracy, shift left incoming number by 2\*N as much as possible (the result
is then shifted left by 1\*N). Ie. Sqrt(2 shl 30) would return 1.41421 shl 15.

Note: The NDS9 and DSi9 additionally support hardware square root calculation,
by math coprocessor, accessed via I/O Ports, however, the SWI function is a raw
software calculation.



## SWI 09h (GBA) - ArcTan


Calculates the arc tangent.

```
  r0   Tan, 16bit (1bit sign, 1bit integral part, 14bit decimal part)
```

Return:

```
  r0   "-PI/2<THETA/<PI/2" in a range of C000h-4000h.
```

Note: there is a problem in accuracy with "THETA\<-PI/4, PI/4\<THETA".



## SWI 0Ah (GBA) - ArcTan2


Calculates the arc tangent after correction processing.

Use this in normal situations.

```
  r0   X, 16bit (1bit sign, 1bit integral part, 14bit decimal part)
  r1   Y, 16bit (1bit sign, 1bit integral part, 14bit decimal part)
```

Return:

```
  r0   0000h-FFFFh for 0<=THETA<2PI.
```




# <a name="biosrotationscalingfunctions"></a>BIOS Rotation/Scaling Functions



BgAffineSet

ObjAffineSet



## SWI 0Eh (GBA) - BgAffineSet


Used to calculate BG Rotation/Scaling parameters.

```
  r0   Pointer to Source Data Field with entries as follows:
        s32  Original data's center X coordinate (8bit fractional portion)
        s32  Original data's center Y coordinate (8bit fractional portion)
        s16  Display's center X coordinate
        s16  Display's center Y coordinate
        s16  Scaling ratio in X direction (8bit fractional portion)
        s16  Scaling ratio in Y direction (8bit fractional portion)
        u16  Angle of rotation (8bit fractional portion) Effective Range 0-FFFF
  r1   Pointer to Destination Data Field with entries as follows:
        s16  Difference in X coordinate along same line
        s16  Difference in X coordinate along next line
        s16  Difference in Y coordinate along same line
        s16  Difference in Y coordinate along next line
        s32  Start X coordinate
        s32  Start Y coordinate
  r2   Number of Calculations
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.



## SWI 0Fh (GBA) - ObjAffineSet


Calculates and sets the OBJ's affine parameters from the scaling ratio and
angle of rotation.

The affine parameters are calculated from the parameters set in Srcp.

The four affine parameters are set every Offset bytes, starting from the Destp
address.

If the Offset value is 2, the parameters are stored contiguously. If the value
is 8, they match the structure of OAM.

When Srcp is arrayed, the calculation can be performed continuously by
specifying Num.

```
  r0   Source Address, pointing to data structure as such:
        s16  Scaling ratio in X direction (8bit fractional portion)
        s16  Scaling ratio in Y direction (8bit fractional portion)
        u16  Angle of rotation (8bit fractional portion) Effective Range 0-FFFF
  r1   Destination Address, pointing to data structure as such:
        s16  Difference in X coordinate along same line
        s16  Difference in X coordinate along next line
        s16  Difference in Y coordinate along same line
        s16  Difference in Y coordinate along next line
  r2   Number of calculations
  r3   Offset in bytes for parameter addresses (2=continuous, 8=OAM)
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.


For both Bg- and ObjAffineSet, Rotation angles are specified as 0-FFFFh
(covering a range of 360 degrees), however, the GBA BIOS recurses only the
upper 8bit; the lower 8bit may contain a fractional portion, but it is ignored
by the BIOS.




# <a name="biosdecompressionfunctions"></a>BIOS Decompression Functions



BitUnPack

Diff8bitUnFilter

HuffUnComp

LZ77UnComp

RLUnComp



## Decompression Read/Write Variants


```
  ReadNormal:      Fast (src must be memory mapped)
  ReadByCallback:  Slow (src can be non-memory, eg. serial Firmware SPI bus)
  Write8bitUnits:  Fast (dest must support 8bit writes, eg. not VRAM)
  Write16bitUnits: Slow (dest must be halfword-aligned) (for VRAM)
```



## BitUnPack - SWI 10h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9)


Used to increase the color depth of bitmaps or tile data. For example, to
convert a 1bit monochrome font into 4bit or 8bit GBA tiles. The Unpack Info is
specified separately, allowing to convert the same source data into different
formats.

```
  r0  Source Address      (no alignment required)
  r1  Destination Address (must be 32bit-word aligned)
  r2  Pointer to UnPack information:
       16bit  Length of Source Data in bytes     (0-FFFFh)
       8bit   Width of Source Units in bits      (only 1,2,4,8 supported)
       8bit   Width of Destination Units in bits (only 1,2,4,8,16,32 supported)
       32bit  Data Offset (Bit 0-30), and Zero Data Flag (Bit 31)
      The Data Offset is always added to all non-zero source units.
      If the Zero Data Flag was set, it is also added to zero units.
```

Data is written in 32bit units, Destination can be Wram or Vram. The size of
unpacked data must be a multiple of 4 bytes. The width of source units (plus
the offset) should not exceed the destination width.

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.



## Diff8bitUnFilterWrite8bit (Wram) - SWI 16h (GBA/NDS9/DSi9)



## Diff8bitUnFilterWrite16bit (Vram) - SWI 17h (GBA)



## Diff16bitUnFilter - SWI 18h (GBA/NDS9/DSi9)


These aren't actually real decompression functions, destination data will have
exactly the same size as source data. However, assume a bitmap or wave form to
contain a stream of increasing numbers such like 10..19, the
filtered/unfiltered data would be:

```
  unfiltered:   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19
  filtered:     10  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1
```

In this case using filtered data (combined with actual compression algorithms)
will obviously produce better compression results.

Data units may be either 8bit or 16bit used with Diff8bit or Diff16bit
functions respectively.

```
  r0  Source address (must be aligned by 4) pointing to data as follows:
       Data Header (32bit)
         Bit 0-3   Data size (must be 1 for Diff8bit, 2 for Diff16bit)
         Bit 4-7   Type (must be 8 for DiffFiltered)
         Bit 8-31  24bit size after decompression
       Data Units (each 8bit or 16bit depending on used SWI function)
         Data0          ;original data
         Data1-Data0    ;difference data
         Data2-Data1    ;...
         Data3-Data2
         ...
  r1  Destination address
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.



## HuffUnCompReadNormal - SWI 13h (GBA)



## HuffUnCompReadByCallback - SWI 13h (NDS/DSi)


The decoder starts in root node, the separate bits in the bitstream specify if
the next node is node0 or node1, if that node is a data node, then the data is
stored in memory, and the decoder is reset to the root node. The most often
used data should be as close to the root node as possible. For example, the
4-byte string "Huff" could be compressed to 6 bits: 10-11-0-0, with root.0
pointing directly to data "f", and root.1 pointing to a child node, whose nodes
point to data "H" and data "u".

Data is written in units of 32bits, if the size of the compressed data is not a
multiple of 4, please adjust it as much as possible by padding with 0.

Align the source address to a 4Byte boundary.

```
  r0  Source Address, aligned by 4, pointing to:
       Data Header (32bit)
         Bit0-3   Data size in bit units (normally 4 or 8)
         Bit4-7   Compressed type (must be 2 for Huffman)
         Bit8-31  24bit size of decompressed data in bytes
       Tree Size (8bit)
         Bit0-7   Size of Tree Table/2-1 (ie. Offset to Compressed Bitstream)
       Tree Table (list of 8bit nodes, starting with the root node)
        Root Node and Non-Data-Child Nodes are:
         Bit0-5   Offset to next child node,
                  Next child node0 is at (CurrentAddr AND NOT 1)+Offset*2+2
                  Next child node1 is at (CurrentAddr AND NOT 1)+Offset*2+2+1
         Bit6     Node1 End Flag (1=Next child node is data)
         Bit7     Node0 End Flag (1=Next child node is data)
        Data nodes are (when End Flag was set in parent node):
         Bit0-7   Data (upper bits should be zero if Data Size is less than 8)
       Compressed Bitstream (stored in units of 32bits)
         Bit0-31  Node Bits (Bit31=First Bit)  (0=Node0, 1=Node1)
  r1  Destination Address
  r2  Callback temp buffer      ;\for NDS/DSi "ReadByCallback" variants only
  r3  Callback structure        ;/(see Callback notes below)
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.



## LZ77UnCompReadNormalWrite8bit (Wram) - SWI 11h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9)



## LZ77UnCompReadNormalWrite16bit (Vram) - SWI 12h (GBA)



## LZ77UnCompReadByCallbackWrite8bit - SWI 01h (DSi7/DSi9)



## LZ77UnCompReadByCallbackWrite16bit - SWI 12h (NDS), SWI 02h or 19h (DSi)


Expands LZ77-compressed data. The Wram function is faster, and writes in units
of 8bits. For the Vram function the destination must be halfword aligned, data
is written in units of 16bits.

- [LZ Decompression Functions](#lzdecompressionfunctions)
CAUTION: Writing 16bit units to [dest-1] instead of 8bit units to [dest] means
that reading from [dest-1] won't work, ie. the "Vram" function works only with
disp=001h..FFFh, but not with disp=000h.

If the size of the compressed data is not a multiple of 4, please adjust it as
much as possible by padding with 0. Align the source address to a 4-Byte
boundary.

```
  r0  Source address, pointing to data as such:
       Data header (32bit)
         Bit 0-3   Reserved (0)
         Bit 4-7   Compressed type (must be 1 for LZ77)
         Bit 8-31  Size of decompressed data
       Repeat below. Each Flag Byte followed by eight Blocks.
       Flag data (8bit)
         Bit 0-7   Type Flags for next 8 Blocks, MSB first
       Block Type 0 - Uncompressed - Copy 1 Byte from Source to Dest
         Bit 0-7   One data byte to be copied to dest

## RLUnCompReadNormalWrite16bit (Vram) - SWI 15h (GBA)



## RLUnCompReadByCallbackWrite16bit - SWI 15h (NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9)


Expands run-length compressed data. The Wram function is faster, and writes in
units of 8bits. For the Vram function the destination must be halfword aligned,
data is written in units of 16bits.

If the size of the compressed data is not a multiple of 4, please adjust it as

         Bit 0-6   Expanded Data Length (uncompressed N-1, compressed N-3)
         Bit 7     Flag (0=uncompressed, 1=compressed)
       Data Byte(s) - N uncompressed bytes, or 1 byte repeated N times
  r1  Destination Address
  r2  Callback parameter        ;\for NDS/DSi "ReadByCallback" variants only
  r3  Callback structure        ;/(see Callback notes below)
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.



## NDS/DSi Decompression Callbacks


On NDS and DSi, the "ReadByCallback" variants are reading source data from
callback functions (rather than directly from memory). The callback functions
may read normal data from memory, or from other devices, such like directly
from the gamepak bus, without storing the source data in memory. The downside
is that the callback mechanism makes the function very slow, furthermore,
NDS7/NDS9 SWI 12h, 13h, 15h are using THUMB code, and variables on stack,
alltogether that makes the whole shit very-very-very slow.

```
  r2 = user defined callback parameter (passed on to Open function)
        (or, for Huffman: pointer to temp buffer, max 200h bytes needed)
  r3 = pointer to callback structure
```

Callback structure (five 32bit pointers to callback functions)

```
  Open_and_get_32bit (eg. LDR r0,[r0], get header)
  Close              (optional, 0=none)
  Get_8bit           (eg. LDRB r0,[r0])
  Get_16bit          (not used)
  Get_32bit          (used by Huffman only)
```

All functions may use ARM or THUMB code (indicated by address bit0). The
current source address (r0) is passed to all callback functions. Additionally,
the initial destination address (r1), and a user defined parameter (r2) are
passed to the Open function. For Huffman r2 must point to a temp buffer (max
200h bytes needed, internally used by the SWI function to make a copy of the
huffman tree; needed for random-access to the tree, which wouldn't work with
the sequentially reading callbacks).

All functions have return values in r0. The Open function normally returns the
first word (containing positive length and type), alternatively it may return a
negative error code to abort/reject decompression. The Close function, if it is
defined, should return zero (or any positive value), or a negative errorcode.
The other functions return raw data, without errorcodes. The SWI returns the
length of decompressed data, or the signed errorcode from the Open/Close
functions.




# <a name="biosmemorycopy"></a>BIOS Memory Copy



CpuFastSet

CpuSet



## SWI 0Ch (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - CpuFastSet


Memory copy/fill in units of 32 bytes. Memcopy is implemented as repeated
LDMIA/STMIA [Rb]!,r2-r9 instructions. Memfill as single LDR followed by
repeated STMIA [Rb]!,r2-r9.

After processing all 32-byte-blocks, the NDS/DSi additonally processes the
remaining words as 4-byte blocks. BUG: The NDS/DSi uses the fast 32-byte-block
processing only for the first N bytes (not for the first N words), so only the
first quarter of the memory block is FAST, the remaining three quarters are
SLOWLY copied word-by-word.

The length is specifed as wordcount, ie. the number of bytes divided by 4.

On the GBA, the length should be a multiple of 8 words (32 bytes) (otherwise
the GBA is forcefully rounding-up the length). On NDS/DSi, the length may be
any number of words (4 bytes).

```
  r0    Source address        (must be aligned by 4)
  r1    Destination address   (must be aligned by 4)
  r2    Length/Mode
          Bit 0-20  Wordcount (GBA: rounded-up to multiple of 8 words)
          Bit 24    Fixed Source Address (0=Copy, 1=Fill by WORD[r0])
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.



## SWI 0Bh (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - CpuSet


Memory copy/fill in units of 4 bytes or 2 bytes. Memcopy is implemented as
repeated LDMIA/STMIA [Rb]!,r3 or LDRH/STRH r3,[r0,r5] instructions. Memfill as
single LDMIA or LDRH followed by repeated STMIA [Rb]!,r3 or STRH r3,[r0,r5].

The length must be a multiple of 4 bytes (32bit mode) or 2 bytes (16bit mode).
The (half)wordcount in r2 must be length/4 (32bit mode) or length/2 (16bit
mode), ie. length in word/halfword units rather than byte units.

```
  r0    Source address        (must be aligned by 4 for 32bit, by 2 for 16bit)
  r1    Destination address   (must be aligned by 4 for 32bit, by 2 for 16bit)
  r2    Length/Mode
          Bit 0-20  Wordcount (for 32bit), or Halfwordcount (for 16bit)
          Bit 24    Fixed Source Address (0=Copy, 1=Fill by {HALF}WORD[r0])
          Bit 26    Datasize (0=16bit, 1=32bit)
```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.


Note: On GBA, NDS7 and DSi7, these two functions will silently reject to do
anything if the source start or end addresses are reaching into the BIOS area.
The NDS9 and DSi9 don't have such read-proctections.




# <a name="bioshaltfunctions"></a>BIOS Halt Functions



Halt

IntrWait

VBlankIntrWait

Stop/Sleep

CustomHalt



## SWI 02h (GBA) or SWI 06h (NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - Halt


Halts the CPU until an interrupt request occurs. The CPU is switched into
low-power mode, all other circuits (video, sound, timers, serial, keypad,
system clock) are kept operating.

Halt mode is terminated when any enabled interrupts are requested, that is when
(IE AND IF) is not zero, the GBA locks up if that condition doesn't get true.
However, the state of CPUs IRQ disable bit in CPSR register, and the IME
register are don't care, Halt passes through even if either one has disabled
interrupts.

On GBA and NDS7/DSi7, Halt is implemented by writing to HALTCNT, Port 4000301h.
On NDS9/DSi9, Halt is implemted by writing to System Control Coprocessor (mov
p15,0,c7,c0,4,r0 opcode), this opcode hangs if IME=0.

No parameters, no return value.

(GBA/NDS7/DSi7: all registers unchanged, NDS9/DSi9: R0 destroyed)



## SWI 04h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - IntrWait ;DSi7/DSi9=bugged?


Continues to wait in Halt state until one (or more) of the specified
interrupt(s) do occur. The function forcefully sets IME=1. When using multiple
interrupts at the same time, this function is having less overhead than
repeatedly calling the Halt function.

```
  r0    0=Return immediately if an old flag was already set (NDS9: bugged!)
        1=Discard old flags, wait until a NEW flag becomes set
  r1    Interrupt flag(s) to wait for (same format as IE/IF registers)
  r2    DSi7 only: Extra flags (same format as DSi7's IE2/IF2 registers)
```

Caution: When using IntrWait or VBlankIntrWait, the user interrupt handler MUST
update the BIOS Interrupt Flags value in RAM; when acknowleding processed
interrupt(s) by writing a value to the IF register, the same value should be
also ORed to the BIOS Interrupt Flags value, at following memory location:

```
  Host     GBA (16bit)  NDS7 (32bit)  NDS9 (32bit)  DSi7-IF2 (32bit)
  Address  [3007FF8h]   [380FFF8h]    [DTCM+3FF8h]  [380FFC0h]
```

NDS9: BUG: No Discard (r0=0) doesn't work. The function always waits for at
least one IRQ to occur (no matter which, including IRQs that are not selected
in r1), even if the desired flag was already set. NB. the same bug is also
found in the GBA/NDS7 functions, but it's compensated by a second bug, ie. the
GBA/NDS7 functions are working okay because their "bug doesn't work".

Return: No return value, the selected flag(s) are automatically reset in BIOS
Interrupt Flags value in RAM upon return.

DSi9: BUG: The function tries to enter Halt state via Port 4000301h (which
would be okay on ARM7, but it's probably ignored on ARM9, which should normally
use CP15 to enter Halt state; if Port 4000301h is really ignored, then the
function will "successfully" wait for interrupts, but without actually entering
any kind of low power mode).

DSi7: BUG: The function tries to wait for IF and IF2 interrupts, but it does
accidently ignore the old IF interrupts, and works only with new IF2 ones.



## SWI 05h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - VBlankIntrWait ;DSi7/DSi9=bugged?


Continues to wait in Halt status until a new V-Blank interrupt occurs.

The function sets r0=1 and r1=1 (plus r2=0 on DSi7) and does then execute
IntrWait (SWI 04h), see IntrWait for details.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 03h (GBA) - Stop


Switches the GBA into very low power mode (to be used similar as a
screen-saver). The CPU, System Clock, Sound, Video, SIO-Shift Clock, DMAs, and
Timers are stopped.

Stop state can be terminated by the following interrupts only (as far as
enabled in IE register): Joypad, Game Pak, or General-Purpose-SIO.

"The system clock is stopped so the IF flag is not set."

Preparation for Stop:

Disable Video before implementing Stop (otherwise Video just freezes, but still
keeps consuming battery power). Possibly required to disable Sound also?
Obviously, it'd be also recommended to disable any external hardware (such like
Rumble or Infra-Red) as far as possible.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 07h (NDS7/DSi7) - Sleep


No info, probably similar as GBA SWI 03h (Stop). Sleep is implemented for ARM7
only, not for ARM9. But maybe the ARM7 function does stop \<both> ARM7 and
ARM9 (?)



## SWI 27h (GBA) or SWI 1Fh (NDS7/DSi7) - CustomHalt (Undocumented)


Writes the 8bit parameter value to HALTCNT, below values are equivalent to Halt
and Stop/Sleep functions, other values reserved, purpose unknown.

```
  r2  8bit parameter (GBA: 00h=Halt, 80h=Stop) (NDS7/DSi7: 80h=Halt, C0h=Sleep)
```

No return value.




# <a name="biosresetfunctions"></a>BIOS Reset Functions



SoftReset

RegisterRamReset

HardReset



## SWI 00h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9) - SoftReset


Clears 200h bytes of RAM (containing stacks, and BIOS IRQ vector/flags),
initializes system, supervisor, and irq stack pointers, sets R0-R12, LR\_svc,
SPSR\_svc, LR\_irq, and SPSR\_irq to zero, and enters system mode.

Note that the NDS9 stack registers are hardcoded (the DTCM base should be set
to the default setting of 0800000h). The NDS9 function additionally flushes
caches and write buffer, and sets the CP15 control register to 12078h.

```
  Host  sp_svc    sp_irq    sp_sys    zerofilled area       return address
  GBA   3007FE0h  3007FA0h  3007F00h  [3007E00h..3007FFFh]  Flag[3007FFAh]
  NDS7  380FFDCh  380FFB0h  380FF00h  [380FE00h..380FFFFh]  Addr[27FFE34h]
  NDS9  0803FC0h  0803FA0h  0803EC0h  [DTCM+3E00h..3FFFh]   Addr[27FFE24h]
```

The NDS7/NDS9 return addresses at [27FFE34h/27FFE24h] are usually containing
copies of Cartridge Header [034h/024h] entry points, which may select ARM/THUMB
state via bit0. The GBA return address 8bit flag is interpreted as 00h=8000000h
(ROM), or 01h-FFh=2000000h (RAM), entered in ARM state.

Note: The reset is applied only to the CPU that has executed the SWI (ie. on
the NDS, the other CPU will remain unaffected).

Return: Does not return to calling procedure, instead, loads the above return
address into R14, and then jumps to that address by a "BX R14" opcode.



## SWI 01h (GBA) - RegisterRamReset


Resets the I/O registers and RAM specified in ResetFlags. However, it does not
clear the CPU internal RAM area from 3007E00h-3007FFFh.

```
  r0  ResetFlags
       Bit   Expl.
       0     Clear 256K on-board WRAM  ;-don't use when returning to WRAM
       1     Clear 32K on-chip WRAM    ;-excluding last 200h bytes
       2     Clear Palette
       3     Clear VRAM
       4     Clear OAM              ;-zerofilled! does NOT disable OBJs!
       5     Reset SIO registers    ;-switches to general purpose mode!
       6     Reset Sound registers
       7     Reset all other registers (except SIO, Sound)
```

Return: No return value.

Bug: LSBs of SIODATA32 are always destroyed, even if Bit5 of R0 was cleared.

The function always switches the screen into forced blank by setting
DISPCNT=0080h (regardless of incoming R0, screen becomes white).



## SWI 26h (GBA) - HardReset (Undocumented)


This function reboots the GBA (including for getting through the time-consuming
nintendo intro, which is making the function particularly useless and
annoying).

Parameters: None. Return: Never/Reboot.

Execution Time: About 2 seconds (!)




# <a name="biosmiscfunctions"></a>BIOS Misc Functions



GetBiosChecksum

WaitByLoop

GetCRC16

IsDebugger

GetSineTable

GetPitchTable

GetVolumeTable

CustomPost

GetBootProcs



## SWI 0Dh (GBA) - GetBiosChecksum (Undocumented)


Calculates the checksum of the BIOS ROM (by reading in 32bit units, and adding
up these values). IRQ and FIQ are disabled during execution.

The checksum is BAAE187Fh (GBA and GBA SP), or BAAE1880h (NDS/3DS in GBA mode,
whereas the only difference is that the byte at [3F0Ch] is changed from 00h to
01h, otherwise the BIOS is 1:1 same as GBA BIOS, it does even include multiboot
code).

Parameters: None. Return: r0=Checksum.



## SWI 03h (NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - WaitByLoop


Performs a "LOP: SUB R0,1 / BGT LOP" wait loop, the loop is executed in BIOS
memory, which provides reliable timings (regardless of the memory waitstates
& cache state of the calling procedure). Intended only for short delays
(eg. flash memory programming cycles).

```
  r0  Delay value (should be in range 1..7FFFFFFFh)
```

Execution time varies for ARM7 vs ARM9. On ARM9 it does also depend on whether
ROM is cached, and on DSi it does further depended on the ARM9 CPU clock, and
on whether using NDS or DSi BIOS ROM (NDS uses faster THUMB code, whilst DSi
uses ARM code, which is slow on uncached ARM9 ROM reads). For example, to get a
1 millisecond delay, use following values:

```
  CPU  Clock     Cache   BIOS     Value for 1ms
  ARM7 33.51MHz  none    NDS/DSi  r0=20BAh    ;=20BAh  ;-ARM7
  ARM9 67.03MHz  on      NDS/DSi  r0=20BAh*2  ;=4174h  ;\ARM9 with cache
  ARM9 134.06MHz on      DSi      r0=20BAh*4  ;=82E8h  ;/
  ARM9 67.03MHz  off     NDS      r0=20BAh/2  ;=105Dh  ;\
  ARM9 67.03MHz  off     DSi      r0=20BAh/4  ;=082Eh  ; ARM9 without cache
  ARM9 134.06MHz off     DSi      r0=20BAh/3  ;=0AE8h  ;/
```

Return: No return value.



## SWI 0Eh (NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - GetCRC16


```
  r0  Initial CRC value (16bit, usually FFFFh)
  r1  Start Address   (must be aligned by 2)
  r2  Length in bytes (must be aligned by 2)
```

CRC16 checksums can be calculated as such:

```
  val[0..7] = C0C1h,C181h,C301h,C601h,CC01h,D801h,F001h,A001h
  for i=start to end
    crc=crc xor byte[i]
    for j=0 to 7
      crc=crc shr 1:if carry then crc=crc xor (val[j] shl (7-j))
    next j
  next i
```

Return:

```
  r0  Calculated 16bit CRC Value
```

Additionally, if the length is nonzero, r3 contains the last processed halfword
at [addr+len-2]. Unlike most other NDS7/DSi7 SWI functions (which do reject
reading from BIOS memory), this allows to dump the NDS7/DSi7 BIOS (except for
the memory region that is locked via BIOSPROT Port 4000308h).



## SWI 0Fh (NDS7/NDS9) - IsDebugger


Detects if 4MB (normal) or 8MB (debug version) Main RAM installed.

Caution: Fails on ARM9 when cache is enabled (always returns 8MB state).

Return: r0 = result (0=normal console 4MB, 1=debug version 8MB)

Destroys halfword at [27FFFFAh] (NDS7) or [27FFFF8h] (NDS9)!

The SWI 0Fh function doesn't work stable if it gets interrupted by an interrupt
which is calling SWI 0Fh, which would destroy the above halfword scratch value
(unless the IRQ handler has saved/restored the halfword).



## SWI 1Ah (NDS7/DSi7) - GetSineTable


```
  r0  Index (0..3Fh) (must be in that range, otherwise returns garbage)
```

Return: r0 = Desired Entry (0000h..7FF5h) ;SIN(0 .. 88.6 degrees)\*8000h



## SWI 1Bh (NDS7/DSi7) - GetPitchTable (DSi7: bugged)


```
  r0  Index (0..2FFh) (must be in that range, otherwise returns garbage)
```

BUG: DSi7 accidently reads from SineTable instead of PitchTable, as workaround
for obtaining PitchTable values, one can set "r0=(0..2FFh)-46Ah" on DSi.

Return: r0 = Desired Entry (0000h..FF8Ah) (unsigned)



## SWI 1Ch (NDS7/DSi7) - GetVolumeTable


```
  r0  Index (0..2D3h) (must be in that range, otherwise returns garbage)
```

Return: r0 = Desired Entry (00h..7Fh) (unsigned)



## SWI 1Fh (NDS9/DSi9) - CustomPost


Writes to the POSTFLG register, probably for use by Firmware boot procedure.

```
  r0  32bit value, to be written to POSTFLG, Port 4000300h
```

Return: No return value.



## SWI 1Dh (NDS7/DSi7) - GetBootProcs


Returns addresses of Gamecart boot procedure/interrupt handler, probably for
use by Firmware boot procedure. Most of the returned NDS7 functions won't work
if the POSTFLG register is set.

The return values are somewhat XORed by each other (on DSi7 most of the values
are zero; which does rather negate the XORing effect, and, as a special
gimmick, one of the zero values is XORed by incoming r2).




# <a name="biosmultibootsinglegamepak"></a>BIOS Multi Boot (Single Game Pak)



MultiBoot



## SWI 25h (GBA) - MultiBoot


This function uploads & starts program code to slave GBAs, allowing to
launch programs on slave units even if no cartridge is inserted into the slaves
(this works because all GBA BIOSes contain built-in download procedures in
ROM).

However, the SWI 25h BIOS upload function covers only 45% of the required
Transmission Protocol, the other 55% must be coded in the master cartridge (see
Transmission Protocol below).

```
  r0  Pointer to MultiBootParam structure
  r1  Transfer Mode (undocumented)
       0=256KHz, 32bit, Normal mode    (fast and stable)
       1=115KHz, 16bit, MultiPlay mode (default, slow, up to three slaves)
       2=2MHz,   32bit, Normal mode    (fastest but maybe unstable)
  Note: HLL-programmers that are using the MultiBoot(param_ptr) macro cannot
  specify the transfer mode and will be forcefully using MultiPlay mode.
```

Return:

```
  r0  0=okay, 1=failed
```

See below for more details.



## Multiboot Parameter Structure


Size of parameter structure should be 4Ch bytes (the current GBA BIOS uses only
first 44h bytes though). The following entries must be set before calling SWI
25h:

```
  Addr Size Name/Expl.
  14h  1    handshake_data (entry used for normal mode only)
  19h  3    client_data[1,2,3]
  1Ch  1    palette_data
  1Eh  1    client_bit (Bit 1-3 set if child 1-3 detected)
  20h  4    boot_srcp  (typically 8000000h+0C0h)
  24h  4    boot_endp  (typically 8000000h+0C0h+length)
```

The transfer length (excluding header data) should be a multiple of 10h,
minimum length 100h, max 3FF40h (ca. 256KBytes). Set palette\_data as
"81h+color\*10h+direction\*8+speed\*2", or as "0f1h+color\*2" for fixed palette,
whereas color=0..6, speed=0..3, direction=0..1. The other entries
(handshake\_data, client\_data[1-3], and client\_bit) must be same as specified in
Transmission Protocol (see below hh,cc,y).



## Multiboot Transfer Protocol


Below describes the complete transfer protocol, normally only the Initiation
part must be programmed in the master cartridge, the main data transfer can be
then performed by calling SWI 25h, the slave program is started after SWI 25h
completion.

The ending handshake is normally not required, when using it, note that you
will need custom code in BOTH master and slave programs.

```

## Multiboot Communication


In Multiplay mode, master sends 16bit data, and receives 16bit data from each
slave (or FFFFh if none). In Normal mode, master sends 32bit data (upper 16bit
zero, lower 16bit as for multiplay mode), and receives 32bit data (upper 16bit
as for multiplay mode, and lower 16bit same as lower 16bit previously sent by
master). Because SIODATA32 occupies same addresses as SIOMULTI0-1, the same
transfer code can be used for both multiplay and normal mode (in normal mode
SIOMULTI2-3 should be forced to FFFFh though). After each transfer, master
should wait for Start bit cleared in SIOCNT register, followed by a 36us delay.

Note: The multiboot slave would also recognize data being sent in Joybus mode,
however, master GBAs cannot use joybus mode (because GBA hardware cannot act as
master in joybus mode).



## Multiboot Slave Header


The transferred Header block is written to 2000000-20000BFh in slave RAM, the
header must contain valid data (identically as for normal ROM-cartridge
headers, including a copy of the Nintendo logo, correct header CRC, etc.), in
most cases it'd be recommended just to transfer a copy of the master cartridges
header from 8000000h-80000BFh.



## Multiboot Slave Program/Data


The transferred main program/data block is written to 20000C0h and up (max
203FFFFh) in slave RAM, note that absolute addresses in the program must be
then originated at 2000000h rather than 8000000h. In case that the master
cartridge is 256K or less, it could just transfer a copy of the whole cartridge
at 80000C0h and up, the master should then copy & execute its own ROM data
into RAM as well.



## Multiboot Slave Extended Header


For Multiboot slaves, separate Entry Point(s) must be defined at the beginning
of the Program/Data block (the Entry Point in the normal header is ignored),
also some reserved bytes in this section are overwritten by the Multiboot
procedure. For more information see chapter about Cartridge Header.



## Multiboot Slave with Cartridge


Beside for slaves without cartridge, multiboot can be also used for slaves
which do have a cartridge inserted, if so, SELECT and START must be kept held
down during power-on in order to switch the slave GBA into Multiboot mode (ie.
to prevent it from starting the cartridge as normally).

The general idea is to enable newer programs to link to any existing older GBA
programs, even if these older programs originally didn't have been intended to
support linking.

The uploaded program may access the slaves SRAM, Flash ROM, or EEPROM (if any,
allowing to read out or modify slave game positions), as well as cartridge ROM
at 80000A0h-8000FFFh (the first 4KBytes, excluding the nintendo logo, allowing
to read out the cartridge name from the header, for example).

The main part of the cartridge ROM is meant to be locked out in order to
prevent software pirates from uploading "intruder" programs which would send
back a copy of the whole cartridge to the master, however, for good or evil, at
present time, current GBA models and GBA carts do not seem to contain any such
protection.



## Uploading Programs from PC


Beside for the ability to upload a program from one GBA to another, this
feature can be also used to upload small programs from a PC to a GBA. For more
information see chapter about External Connectors.



## Nintendo DS


The GBA multiboot function requires a link port, and so, works on GBA and GBA
SP only. The Nintendo DS in GBA mode does include the multiboot BIOS function,
but it won't be of any use as the DS doesn't have a link port.

## SWI 1Fh (GBA) - MidiKey2Freq


Calculates the value of the assignment to ((SoundArea)sa).vchn[x].fr when
playing the wave data, wa, with the interval (MIDI KEY) mk and the fine
adjustment value (halftones=256) fp.

```
  r0  WaveData* wa
  r1  u8 mk
  r2  u8 fp
```

Return:

```
  r0  u32
```

This function is particularly popular because it allows to read from BIOS
memory without copy protection range checks. The formula to read one byte (a)
from address (i, 0..3FFF) is:

a = (MidiKey2Freq(i-(((i AND 3)+1)OR 3), 168, 0) \* 2) SHR 24



## SWI 19h (GBA) or SWI 08h (NDS7/DSi7) - SoundBias


Increments or decrements the current level of the SOUNDBIAS register (with
short delays) until reaching the desired new level. The upper bits of the
register are kept unchanged.

```
  r0   BIAS level (0=Level 000h, any other value=Level 200h)
  r1   Delay Count (NDS/DSi only) (GBA uses a fixed delay count of 8)
```

Return: No return value.



## SWI 1Eh (GBA) - SoundChannelClear


Clears all direct sound channels and stops the sound.

This function may not operate properly when the library which expands the sound
driver feature is combined afterwards. In this case, do not use it.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 1Ah (GBA) - SoundDriverInit


Initializes the sound driver. Call this only once when the game starts up.

It is essential that the work area already be secured at the time this function
is called.

You cannot execute this driver multiple times, even if separate work areas have
been prepared.

                      value as the loop pointer data for a looped waveform.
```

Return: No return value.



## SWI 1Ch (GBA) - SoundDriverMain


Main of the sound driver.

Call every 1/60 of a second. The flow of the process is to call
SoundDriverVSync, which is explained later, immediately after the V-Blank
interrupt.

After that, this routine is called after BG and OBJ processing is executed.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 1Bh (GBA) - SoundDriverMode


Sets the sound driver operation mode.

```
  r0  Sound driver operation mode
       Bit    Expl.
       0-6    Direct Sound Reverb value (0-127, default=0) (ignored if Bit7=0)
       7      Direct Sound Reverb set (0=ignore, 1=apply reverb value)
       8-11   Direct Sound Simultaneously-produced (1-12 channels, default 8)
       12-15  Direct Sound Master volume (1-15, default 15)
       16-19  Direct Sound Playback Frequency (1-12 = 5734,7884,10512,13379,
              15768,18157,21024,26758,31536,36314,40137,42048, def 4=13379 Hz)
       20-23  Final number of D/A converter bits (8-11 = 9-6bits, def. 9=8bits)
       24-31  Not used.
```

Return: No return value.



## SWI 1Dh (GBA) - SoundDriverVSync


An extremely short system call that resets the sound DMA. The timing is
extremely critical, so call this function immediately after the V-Blank
interrupt every 1/60 second.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 28h (GBA) - SoundDriverVSyncOff


Due to problems with the main program if the V-Blank interrupts are stopped,
and SoundDriverVSync cannot be called every 1/60 a second, this function must
be used to stop sound DMA.

Otherwise, even if you exceed the limit of the buffer the DMA will not stop and
noise will result.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 29h (GBA) - SoundDriverVSyncOn


This function restarts the sound DMA stopped with the previously described
SoundDriverVSyncOff.

After calling this function, have a V-Blank occur within 2/60 of a second and
call SoundDriverVSync.

No parameters, no return value.



## SWI 20h..24h (GBA) - SoundWhatever0..4 (Undocumented)


Whatever undocumented sound-related BIOS functions.



## SWI 2Ah (GBA) - SoundGetJumpList (Undocumented)


Receives pointers to 36 additional sound-related BIOS functions.

```
  r0  Destination address (must be aligned by 4) (120h bytes buffer)
```

## SWI 24h (DSi9/DSi7) - SHA1\_Init(struct)


Initializes a 64h-byte structure for SHA1 calculations:

```
  [struct+00h] = 67452301h      ;\
  [struct+04h] = EFCDAB89h      ;
  [struct+08h] = 98BADCFEh      ; initial SHA1 checksum value

  if [struct+60h] = 00000000h then [struct+60h] = SHA1_Default_Callback
```

Observe that the incoming [struct+60h] value should be 00000000h, otherwise the
default callback isn't installed (using a different callback doesn't make too
much sense, and it's probably not done by any DSi programs) (the callback
feature might be intended to mount hardware accelleration, or to hook,
customize, encrypt, or replace the SHA1 functionality).



## SWI 25h (DSi9/DSi7) - SHA1\_Update(struct,src,srclen)

4-byte aligned).

## SWI 20h (DSi9/DSi7) - RSA\_Init\_crypto\_heap(heap\_nfo,heap\_start,heap\_size)


Initializes the heap for use with SWI 21h..23h. heap\_nfo is a 0Ch-byte
structure, which gets set to:

```
  [heap_nfo+0] = heap_start (rounded-up to 4-byte boundary)
  [heap_nfo+4] = heap_end   (start+size, rounded-down to 4-byte boundary)
  [heap_nfo+8] = heap_size  (matched to above rounded values)
```

heap\_start should point to a free memory block which will be used as heap,
heap\_size should be usually 1000h.



## SWI 21h (DSi9/DSi7) - RSA\_Decrypt(heap\_nfo,ptr\_nfo,len\_dest)


```
  [ptr_nfo+0] = dst (usually 7Fh bytes, max 80h bytes)
  [ptr_nfo+4] = src (80h bytes)
  [ptr_nfo+8] = key (80h bytes)
```

This is a subfunction for SWI 22h/23h. It's returning raw decrypted data
without unpadding (aside from stripping leading 00h bytes; most (or all)
signatures are containing one leading 00h byte, so the returned [len\_dest]
value will be usually 7Fh).

Return value (r0) is: 0=failed, 1=okay. The length of the decrypted data is
returned at [len\_dest].



## SWI 22h (DSi9/DSi7) - RSA\_Decrypt\_Unpad(heap\_nfo,dst,src,key)


Same as SWI 21h, and additionally removes the "01h,min eight FFh,00h" padding.
src,dst,key should be 80h-bytes. The output at dst can be theoretically max
80h-bytes (or shorter due to removed padding). In practice, the DSi is often
using only the first 14h-bytes at dst (aka the last 14h-bytes from src) as SHA1
or SHA1-HMAC value (RSA-SHA1). Return value (r0) is: 0=failed, 1=okay.



## SWI 23h (DSi9/DSi7) - RSA\_Decrypt\_Unpad\_OpenPGP\_SHA1(heap\_nfo,dst,src,key)


Same as SWI 22h, but with some extra processing for extracting a SHA1 value
from an OpenPGP header: The data must consist of five ASN.1 (DER) chunks (with
Tag IDs 30h,30h,06h,05h,04h), the last chunk (with ID=04h) must be 14h bytes in
size, and the 14h-byte chunk data is then copied to dst. The other four chunks
must exist, but their content is just skipped.

```
  00h 1    Leading zero       (00h)                           ;\
  01h 1    Block type         (01h)                           ; padding
  02h 5Ah  Padding Bytes      (FFh-filled)                    ;
  5Ch 1    Padding End        (00h)                           ;/
  5Dh 2    30h,junk(1)        (30h,21h)                       ;-sequence
  5Fh 2    30h,junk(1)        (30h,09h)                       ;-sequence
  61h 7    06h,len,junk(len)  (06h,05h, 2Bh,0Eh,03h,02h,1Ah)  ;-OID for SHA1
  68h 2    05h,junk(1)        (05h,00h)                       ;-null
  6Ah 16h  04h,len,sha1(len)  (04h,14h, sha1[14h bytes])      ;-SHA1
```

The "junk" bytes aren't actually used/verified by the DSi. Handling chunks with
len>7Fh looks quite weird/bugged. The DSi firmware contains some functions
where it could optionally use SWI 22h or SWI 23h for RSA signatures (although,
there aren't any known cases where it would actually use SWI 23h). Note: The
DSi's Flipnote ".ppm" files are using the SWI 23h style SHA1 format (but
Flipnote contains it's own RSA functions instead of using the BIOS SWI
functions). DS Download Play (and equivalent code in NDS Firmware) is SWI 23h
style, too (but also uses its own RSA function instead of the BIOS SWI).

Note: The format is based on the OpenPGP Message Format (RFC 4880), that format
allows to use similar headers for MD5, SHA256, etc. (the DSi supports only SHA1
though).



## Unencrypted Signatures


Emulators can hook the RSA BIOS functions to copy unencrypted signatures as-is
(instead of trying to decrypt them). That allows to create "authentic" files
that are fully compatible with the DSi firmware, and which would be actually
working on real hardware (when knowing the private key).

Unencrypted 80h-byte signatures should be stored in following format (as
defined in RFC 2313):

```
  00h   1      "00" Leading zero (00h)
  01h   1      "BT" Block type (always 01h on DSi)
  02h   8+n    "PS" Padding (FFh-filled, min 8 bytes, usually 69h bytes on DSi)
  0Ah+n 1      "00" Padding end (00h)
  0Bh+n 75h-n  "D"  Data (max 75h bytes, usually a 14h-byte SHA1 value on DSi)
```

If the hooked BIOS function sees a RSA source to contain "00h, 01h, at least
eight FFh, followed by 00h", then it could treat it as unencrypted data (it's
nearly impossible that an encrypted signature could contain those values).



## Key.Bit0


The DSi BIOS contains two different RSA core modes (either one of them is used,
depending on whether BIT0 of the FIRST BYTE of the "key" is set or cleared).
The purpose & difference between those two modes is unknown. Also, dunno if
that BIT0 thing is something common in the RSA world?

## DSi Private RSA Keys (for creating signatures)


Nintendo's private keys should be known only by Nintendo. However, the console
does have a few "own" private keys (for sending signed data to Nintendo
(verdata), for storing signed data on SD card (flipnote), plus some more keys
for the developer's debug version).

```
  Flipnote       (26,A7,53,7E..) Private key for Flipnote .ppm files
  dev.kp         (per-console)   TWxxxxxxxx... key for tad files (ECC, non-RSA)

  Debug Updater  (B5,7C,C2,85..) Private key for Debug HWInfo
  Debug SDK      (95,DC,C8,18..) Private key for Debug DSiware/ROMs (Debug3)
  Unknown        (?)             further keys...?
```

The private keys are usually stored in DER format; that's including entries for
the public key/exponent, and the original prime numbers that the key was
generated from, plus some numbers that were temporarily used during key
creation, and with all entries preceeded by tag/length values, whereas values
with MSB set are preceeded by a 00h byte to make them "unsigned" (eg. most
80h-byte keys will occupy 81h bytes in DER format).




# <a name="biosrsabasics"></a>BIOS RSA Basics




## RSA Basics


The RSA formulas are quite simple: Applying an exponent and modulus to the
source data. There are two formulas used for encryption/decryption. The first
formula requires only the Public Key (and an exponent, which is usually some
fixed constant; on the DSi it's always 10001h aka 65537 decimal). The second
formula is almost same, but requires the Private Key instead of the constant
exponent (and also requires the Public Key as modulus):

```
  Public Key formula:      dest = src^10001h mod pubkey
  Private Key formula:     dest = src^prvkey mod pubkey
```

That formulas can be used for encrypting secret messages, as so:

```
  Recipient's Public Key   --> Encrypt a message
  Recipient's Private Key  --> Decrypt a message
```

Or, using the formulas the other way around, to create digital signatures:

```
  Sender's Private Key     --> Encrypt/create a signature
  Sender's Public Key      --> Decrypt/verify a signature
```

The overall idea is that only the owner of the Private Key can decrypt
messages, or create signatures. The Public Key can be shared freely, so that
everybody can encrypt messages, or verify signatures.



## RSA Big Number Maths


The exponent/modulus can be implemented with simple unsigned multiply/divide
operations. However, RSA requires dealing with big 1024bit integers (or even
bigger numbers when using larger keys), this does usually require some software
functions since regular CPUs cannot directly deal with such large numbers.



## RSA Byte Order


The DSi is storing all RSA keys and signatures in Big-Endian format, so one
will need to reverse the byte order before doing the actual maths on
Little-Endian CPUs.



## RSA Signatures (used on DSi)


Digital signatures can be used for signing documents or other binaries. The
signature does usually consist of a secure checksum (SHA-1, MD5, SHA256, etc.)
computed on the document/binary, and then encrypted via the RSA Private Key
formula.

The checksum can be then decrypted via Public Key, if the decrypted checksum
does match up, then one can be sure that the document/binary hasn't been
modified, and that it was really created by the Private Key owner.



## RSA Encrypted Messages (not used on DSi)


Encrypted RSA messages are restricted to the size of the Public Key (eg. with a
1024bit key, the message should be smaller than 128 bytes). For bigger
messages, one could either split the message into smaller snippets, or, one
could combine RSA with some other encryption mechanism (eg. store an AES key in
the RSA message, and decrypt the actual document via AES; that would add
private/public key security to AES).



## RSA Padding


RSA can be weak if the message is a small number (especially very small values
like "0" or "1" obviously wouldn't work well with the "msg^exp" maths; other
small values can be also weak, eg. with the common/small public exponent
10001h). To avoid that problem, the MSBs of the message should be padded with
nonzero bytes, typically as so (as defined in RFC 2313):

```
  00h   1      "00" Leading zero (00h)
  01h   1      "BT" Block type (always 01h on DSi)
  02h   8+n    "PS" Padding (FFh-filled, min 8 bytes, usually 69h bytes on DSi)
  0Ah+n 1      "00" Padding end (00h)
  0Bh+n 75h-n  "D"  Data (max 75h bytes, usually a 14h-byte SHA1 value on DSi)
```

That, for 80h-byte messages. For other sizes replace "75h" by "F5h, 1F5h, etc."



## RSA Key Generation


Generating a RSA key pair is more difficult than the encryption/decryption
part. First of, one needs two unsigned random prime numbers; for a 1024bit key,
that would be usually two large 512bit prime numbers (whereas, finding real
prime numbers is complicated, and it's more common to use values that have a
"high probability" of being prime numbers).

The public key is then simply generated by multiplying the two prime numbers (P
and Q) with each other:

```
  pubkey = P * Q
```

The private key is also based on the same prime numbers, but the maths there
are more complicated (and not described here).

When knowing one prime number, one could theoretically compute the other as
"Q=pubkey/P", however, prime numbers aren't as rare as one might think, and
it's quite impossible to guess (or brute-force) one of the prime numbers.




# <a name="biosrsapseudocode"></a>BIOS RSA Pseudo Code




## rsa\_mpi\_pow\_mod(dst,src,pubkey,exp,num\_exp\_bits) ;[dst]=[src]^[exp] mod [key]


```
  base(rsa__number_size), bigbuf(rsa_number_size*2)
  [base]=[src], [dst]=1, pow8bit=01h                ;-init base, result, powbit
  for i=1 to num_exp_bits
    if [exp] AND pow8bit then rsa_mpi_mul_mod(dst,base)   ;-mul result
    rsa_mpi_mul_mod(base,base)                            ;-square base
    pow8bit=pow8bit ROL 1, exp=exp+carry                  ;-next exp bit
  next i
  return
```

This is the RSA main function. The exponent is applied by squaring the "src"
several times, and, if the corresponding exponent bit is set, multiplying the
result by the squared value. To avoid the numbers to become incredible large,
the modulus is applied after each multiplication (rather than applying it only
on the final result).

```
  For the Private Key formula: Use exp=prvkey, num_exp_bits=rsa_number_size*8
  For the Public Key formula:  Use exp=ptr_to_10001h, num_exp_bits=17
```

The parameters and result for "rsa\_mpi\_pow\_mod" must be in little-endian. Ie.
for DSi, reverse the byte order of the incoming/outgoing values. And, on DSi,
use rsa\_number\_size=80h (aka 128 bytes, aka for 1024bit RSA).

```

The ARM11 exception vectors are shared for all CPU cores (so one must manually
redirect them to core specific handlers).

Alternately, instead of using the above RAM vectors, one could use ARM11
virtual memory or ARM9 ITCM for custom vectors.

Moreover, the CFG11\_BOOTROM\_OVERLAY\_CNT/VAL feature allows to redirect ARM11
vectors on New3DS (mainly intended for booting CPU2/CPU3 cores).



## SWI/SVC Functions


There aren't any built-in functions in the bootroms, however, SVC opcodes can
be used to obtain entrypoints to OS functions. That is, once when the OS is
booted (FIRM files are started without any OS functions, but .code files can
use OS functions).

Note: ARM has renamed SWI opcodes to SVC opcodes.




# <a name="biosramusage"></a>BIOS RAM Usage



Below contains info about RAM contents at cartridge boot time (as initialized
by the BIOS/Firmware), plus info about RAM locations used by IRQ handlers and
SWI functions.



## GBA BIOS RAM Usage


Below memory at 3007Fxxh is often accessed directly, or via mirrors at
3FFFFxxh.

```
  3000000h 7F00h User Memory and User Stack              (sp_usr=3007F00h)
  3007F00h A0h   Default Interrupt Stack (6 words/time)  (sp_irq=3007FA0h)
  3007FA0h 40h   Default Supervisor Stack (4 words/time) (sp_svc=3007FE0h)
  3007FE0h 10h   Debug Exception Stack (4 words/time)    (sp_xxx=3007FF0h)
  3007FF0h 4     Pointer to Sound Buffer (for SWI Sound functions)
  3007FF4h 3     Reserved (unused)
  3007FF7h 1     Reserved (intro/nintendo logo related)
  3007FF8h 2     IRQ IF Check Flags (for SWI IntrWait/VBlankIntrWait functions)
  3007FFAh 1     Soft Reset Re-entry Flag (for SWI SoftReset function)
  3007FFBh 1     Reserved (intro/multiboot slave related)
  3007FFCh 4     Pointer to user IRQ handler (to 32bit ARM code)
```



## NDS BIOS RAM Usage


Below memory at 27FFxxxh is mirrored to 23FFxxxh (on retail consoles with 4MB
RAM), however, it should be accessed via address 27FFxxxh (for compatibility
with debug consoles with 8MB RAM). Accessing it via mirrors at 2FFFxxxh is also
valid (this is done by DSi enhanced games; even when running in non-DSi mode;
this allows DSi games to use the same memory addresses in NDS and DSi mode).

```



## GBA BIOS


Contains SWI Functions and Bootcode (for starting cartridges, or booting via
Serial Port). The GBA BIOS can be read only by opcodes executed in BIOS area,
for example, via the MidiKey2Freq function (most other SWI Functions (like
CpuSet) are refusing source addresses within BIOS area).



## NDS BIOSes


Contains SWI Functions and Bootcode (for booting from SPI Bus Firmware FLASH
memory). The NDS9 BIOS can be dumped without restrictions (eg. via CpuSet, or
via LDR opcodes in RAM). The NDS7 BIOS has same restrictions as GBA, ie.
reading works only by BIOS opcodes, and not by functions like CpuSet. The
GetCRC16 functions does work though (at least for memory at 1204h..3FFFh). As
an additional obstacle, memory at 0000h..1203h can be dumped only by opcodes
within 0000h..1203h (that memory does mainly contain data, but some of the data
values can serve as THUMB LDR opcodes). For details see:

- [DS Memory Control - BIOS](ds.html#dsmemorycontrolbios)
Note: DSi consoles are containing a copy of the NDS BIOSes, but with BIOSPROT
set to 0020h (even when running in NDS mode), so the first 20h bytes of the
DSi's NDS7 BIOS aren't dumpable (except via tracing, see below), that 20h bytes
should be just same as on original NDS7 though.



## DSi BIOSes - Lower 32K-halves (SWI Functions)


The lower 32K of DSi9 doesn't have any restricions. The lower 32K of DSi7 has
similar restrictions as NDS7, but with BIOSPROT set to 0020h (instead of
1204h), this is making it more easy to dump memory at 0020h..7FFFh (eg. via
GetCRC16), but makes it impossible to dump the exception vectors at
0000h..001Fh, however, they can be deduced by tracing (with timer IRQs):

```
  ROM:00000000h  EA000006  b 20h   ;dsi7_reset_vector
  ROM:00000004h  EA000006  b 24h   ;dsi7_undef_handler
  ROM:00000008h  EA00001F  b 8Ch   ;dsi7_swi_handler
  ROM:0000000Ch  EA000004  b 24h   ;dsi7_prefetch_abort_handler
  ROM:00000010h  EA000003  b 24h   ;dsi7_data_abort_handler
  ROM:00000014h  EAFFFFFE  b 14h   ;reserved_vector
  ROM:00000018h  EA000013  b 6Ch   ;dsi7_irq_handler
  ROM:0000001Ch  EA000000  b 24h   ;dsi7_fiq_handler
```

Aside from branch opcodes, above could theoretically contain ALU opcodes that
modify R15 (but that would be very unlikely, and would make no difference)
(and, the above 20h bytes are dumped/confirmed on 3DS in DSi mode).



## DSi BIOSes - Upper 32K-halves (Bootcode, for booting from eMMC memory)


The upper 32K of the DSi9 and DSi7 BIOSes are locked at some point during
booting, and there's no known way to dump them directly. However, portions of
that memory are relocated to RAM/TCM before locking, and that relocated copies
can be dumped.

On a DSi, the following DSi ROM data can be dumped (originally done via Main
Memory hacks, ie. with complex external hardware soldered to the mainboard, but
it's now also possible via Unlaunch.dsi exploit):

```
  ROM:FFFF87F4h / TCM:1FFC400h (400h)  (C3 02 93 DE ..) RSA keys (8x80h)
  ROM:FFFF9920h / TCM:1FFC800h (80h)   (30 33 26 D5 ..) Whatever
  ROM:FFFF99A0h / TCM:1FFC894h (1048h) (99 D5 20 5F ..) Blowfish/NDS-mode
  ROM:FFFFA9E8h / TCM:1FFD8DCh (1048h) (D8 18 FA BF ..) Blowfish/unused?
  ROM:00008188h / RAM:3FFC400h (200h)  (CA 13 31 79 ..) Whatever, 32x10h AES?
  ROM:0000B5D8h / RAM:3FFC600h (40h)   (AF 1B F5 16 ..) Whatever, "common key"?
  ROM:0000C6D0h / RAM:3FFC654h (1048h) (59 AA 56 8E ..) Blowfish/DSi-mode
  ROM:0000D718h / RAM:3FFD69Ch (1048h) (54 86 13 3B ..) Blowfish/unused?
```

On a 3DS, the following "DSi ROM data" can be dumped from the 2470h-byte DSi
key area in 3DS memory at ARM9 ITCM 01FFD000h..01FFF46F (via 3DS exploits that
are capable of executing code on ARM9 side):

```
  ROM:FFFF87F4h / 3DS:01FFD000h  200h  RSA keys 0..3 (4x80h)
  ROM:00008308h / 3DS:01FFD200h  80h   some AES keys
  ROM:FFFF9920h / 3DS:01FFD280h  80h   whatever
  ROM:0000B5D8h / 3DS:01FFD300h  40h   AES keys and values (common etc)
  ROM:?         / 3DS:01FFD340h  A0h   misc "Nintendo" string etc.
  ROM:0000C6D0h / 3DS:01FFD3E0h  1048h Blowfish for DSi-mode
  ROM:FFFF99A0h / 3DS:01FFE428h  1048h Blowfish for DS-mode
```

The 3DS does have only half of the DSi keys (the extra keys might be used for
DSi debug version, but aren't needed for normal DSi software).

The 40h-byte area for ROM:0000B5D8h can be fully dumped from 3DS ITCM, the same
vales should also exist in DSi ITCM, but the DSi zerofills a 10h-byte fraction
of that area after initialization, and it doesn't seem be possible to read that
values via Main Memory hacks (most of that erased values can be found in AES
keyslots though).

The A0h-byte area is found only in 3DS ITCM, it should also exist somewhere in
DSi ROM, but isn't relocated to DSi ITCM (however, the relevant values can be
found in AES keyslots, eg. the "Nintendo" string).

## 3DS BIOS


Can be dumped by crashing the 3DS with wrong voltages, or by using sighax to
crash the bootrom before disabling the upper 32Kbyte halves of the ARM9/ARM11
ROMs.



## DSiWifi BIOS


The Wifi BIOS can be dumped by using the WINDOW\_DATA register via SDIO CMD53.



## Further DSi BIOSes


The DSi cameras and several other I2C/SPI devices are probably having BIOS
ROMs, too. Unknown if/how that ROMs are dumpable.



## DSi BIOS Dumping via voltage errors


Lowering VDD12 for a moment does work quite reliable for crashing the ARM9 and
trapping the 2FFFD9Ch vector in Main RAM. The problem is that Main RAM seems to
be disabled during bootstage 1 (it gets enabled at begin of bootstage 2 via
EXMEMCNT, that is, shortly after the upper BIOS 32Kbyte areas are disabled).
More on that here:

- [http://4dsdev.kuribo64.net/thread.php?id=130](http://4dsdev.kuribo64.net/thread.php?id=130)

One theory/idea (from dark\_samus) is that EXMEMCNT controls the CE2 pin on the
Main RAM chip, so one could try to rewire that pin to get Main RAM enabled
regardless of EXMEMCNT, if that's actually working, then trapping the 2FFFD9Ch
vector should work even while BIOS ROMs are fully readable.

## Game Pak Bus - 32pin cartridge slot


The cartridge bus may be used for both CGB and GBA game paks. In GBA mode, it
is used as follows:

```
 Pin    Name    Dir  Expl.
 1      VDD     O    Power Supply 3.3V DC
 2      PHI     O    System Clock (selectable none, 4.19MHz, 8.38MHz, 16.78MHz)
 3      /WR     O    Write Select    ;\latched address to be incremented on
 4      /RD     O    Read Select     ;/rising edges of /RD or /WR signals
 5      /CS     O    ROM Chip Select ;-A0..A15 to be latched on falling edge
 6-21   AD0-15  I/O  lower 16bit Address    and/or  16bit ROM-data (see below)
 22-29  A16-23  I/O  upper 8bit ROM-Address   or    8bit SRAM-data (see below)
 30     /CS2    O    SRAM Chip Select
 31     /REQ    I    Interrupt request (/IREQ) or DMA request (/DREQ)
 32     GND     O    Ground 0V
```

When accessing game pak SRAM, a 16bit address is output through AD0-AD15, then
8bit of data are transferred through A16-A23.

When accessing game pak ROM, a 24bit address is output through AD0-AD15 and
A16-A23, then 16bit of data are transferred through AD0-AD15.

The 24bit address is formed from the actual 25bit memory address (byte-steps),
divided by two (halfword-steps).

Pin Pitch is 1.5mm.



## 8bit-Gamepak-Switch (GBA, GBA SP only) (not DS)


A small switch is located inside of the cartridge slot, the switch is pushed
down when an 8bit cartridge is inserted, it is released when a GBA cartridge is
inserted (or if no cartridge is inserted).

The switch mechanically controls whether VDD3 or VDD5 are output at VDD35; ie.
in GBA mode 3V power supply/signals are used for the cartridge slot and link
port, while in 8bit mode 5V are used.

The switch additionally drags IN35 to 3V when an 8bit cart is inserted, the
current state of IN35 can be determined in GBA mode via Port 4000204h
(WAITCNT), if the switch is pushed, then CGB mode can be activated via Port
4000000h (DISPCNT.3), this bit can be set ONLY by opcodes in BIOS region (eg.
via CpuSet SWI function).

In 8bit mode, the cartridge bus works much like for GBA SRAM, however, the 8bit
/CS signal is expected at Pin 5, while GBA SRAM /CS2 at Pin 30 is interpreted
as /RESET signal by the 8bit MBC chip (if any). In practice, this appears to
result in 00h being received as data when attempting to read-out 8bit
cartridges from inside of GBA mode.

through data lines during next following eight CLK pulses, after the command
transmission, further CLK pulses are used to transfer data, the data transfer
ends at chipselect Low-to-High transition.

Data should be stable during CLK=LOW period throughout CLK rising edge.

Note: Supply Pins (1,8,17) are slightly longer than other pins. Pin pitch is
1.5mm.


The DS does also have a 32pin cartridge slot, that slot is used to run GBA
carts in GBA mode, it can be also used as expansion port in DS mode.

## Normal Connection


Just connect the plugs to the two GBAs and leave the Middle Socket
disconnected, in this mode both GBAs may behave as master or slave, regardless
of whether using big or small plugs.

The GBA is (NOT ???) able to communicate in Normal mode with MultiPlay cables
which do not have crossed SI/SO lines.



## Multi-Play Connection


Connect two GBAs as normal, for each further GBAs connect an additional cable
to the Middle socket of the first (or further) cable(s), up to four GBAs may be
connected by using up to three cables.

The GBA which is connected to a Small Plug is master, the slaves are all
connected to Large Plugs. (Only small plugs fit into the Middle Socket, so it's
not possible to mess up something here).



## Multi-Boot Connection


MultiBoot (SingleGamepak) is typically using Multi-Play communication, in this
case it is important that the Small plug is connected to the master/sender (ie.
to the GBA that contains the cartridge).



## Non-GBA Mode Connection


First of all, it is not possible to link between 32bit GBA games and 8bit
games, parts because of different cable protocol, and parts because of
different signal voltages.

However, when a 8bit cartridge is inserted (the GBA is switched into 8bit
compatibility mode) it may be connected to other 8bit games (monochrome
gameboys, CGBs, or to other GBAs which are in 8bit mode also, but not to GBAs
in 32bit mode).

When using 8bit link mode, an 8bit link cable must be used. The GBA link cables
won't work, see below modification though.



## Using a GBA 32bit cable for 8bit communication


Open the middle socket, and disconnect Small Plugs SI from GND, and connect SI
to Large Plugs SO instead. You may also want to install a switch that allows to
switch between SO and GND, the GND signal should be required for MultiPlay
communication only though.

Also, cut off the plastic ledge from the plugs so that they fit into 8bit
gameboy sockets.



## Using a GBA 8bit cable for 32bit communication


The cable should theoretically work as is, as the grounded SI would be required
for MultiPlay communication only. However, software that uses SD for
Slave-Ready detection won't work unless when adding a SD-to-SD connection (the
8bit plugs probably do not even contain SD pins though).

The NDS socket doesn't fully match regular 3.5mm plugs, one needs to cut-off a
portion of the DS case to be able to fully insert the plug, which still
requires a lot of pressure, furthermore, when fully inserted, left/right become
shortcut to mono, so one needs to pull-back the plug a bit to gain stereo
output.

GBA-SP/NDS: DC 5.2V (or DC 5V) (special connector on power/headphone socket)

NDS-Lite: DC 5.2V (or DC 5V) (another special connector on power socket)



## Internal Battery Supply


GBA: 2xAA (3V)

GBA-SP: Li-ion 3.7V, 600mAh (built-in, recharge-able)

GBA-Micro: Li-ion 3.8V, 460mAh (built-in, recharge-able)

NDS: Li-ion 3.7V, 850mAh (built-in, recharge-able)

NDS-Lite: Li-ion 3.7V, 1000mAh (built-in, recharge-able)



## Using PC +5V DC as Power Supply


Developers whom are using a PC for GBA programming will probably want to use
the PC power supply (gained from disk drive power supply cable) for the GBA as
well rather than dealing with batteries or external power supplies.

GBA: To lower the voltage to approximately 3 Volts use two diodes, type 1N 4004
or similar, the ring printed onto the diodes points towards the GBA side,
connected as such:

```
  PC +5V (red)   --------|>|---|>|--------  GBA BT+
  PC GND (black) -------------------------  GBA BT-
```

GBA SP, GBA Micro, NDS, and NDS-Lite: Works directly at +5V connected to EXT.2
socket (not to the internal battery pins), without any diodes.

Moreover, the card sockets (not the cards themselves) are usually containing a
Card Detect switch, and, for SD card sockets, also a write protect switch:

```
  --   --      CD  CD     CD      Card Detect (senses if card is inserted)
  --   ---     WP  --     --      Write Protect (senses position of LOCK tab)
```

Note that the LOCK tab on SD cards is just a small piece of plastic without any
electronics attached to it, the actual switch/sensor is located in the SD card
socket (ie. the LOCK works much like the write-protect tabs on audio tapes,
video tapes, and floppy discs).

Card detect can be an actual switch (however, some sockets are simply having
dual contacts for Pin 3 (GND), one being GND, and the other becoming GNDed when
a cartridge is inserted).

## SD/MMC Signals for on-board eMMC chip on DSi Mainboard "C/TWL-CPU-01"


Below are the required eMMC signals. Low-end hardware may get away with using
Data0 as single data line (eg. small microprocessors with few I/O pins), but
higher quality hardware should support 4bit data mode (eg. off-the-shelve SD
card interfaces may insist on all four data lines being connected). Data3 (aka
CardDetect) might be also needed even in 1bit data mode.

For other DSi mainboards, see:

- [http://www.dsibrew.org/wiki/Hardware](http://www.dsibrew.org/wiki/Hardware)

The KMAPF0000M chip does probably NOT support SPI mode, and it does probably
support only MMC protocol (not SD protocol). That, assuming that the chip does
have similar capabilities as in KMCEN0000M datasheet (there's no KMAPF0000M
datasheet online).



## SD/MMC Signals and 3DS Hardmodding


Pictures with eMMC solder pads for 3DS mainboards boards can be found at:

- [https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Hardware](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Hardware)

However, hardmodding is much more difficult for 3DS as than for DSi. Three
3DS-specific problems:


## CLK resistor

  - The 3DS tends to hold CLK low, and there is no resistor installed between
  - 3DS CPU and eMMC chip, so the card reader may be unable to pull CLK high.
  - As workaround, install a resistor in the CLK line (the mainboard has square
  - solder pads just for that purpose) (330..660 ohms have worked for me, I am
  - currently using 470 ohms; smaller resistors like 0..120 ohm won't work with
  - the card reader, and much larger resistors won't work with the 3DS itself).

## Incompatible Card readers

  - Newer 3DS/New3DS models seem to contain eMMC chips that are incompatible with
  - older card readers, maybe because their firmware/driver treats the CSD
  - version number as unknown, despite of the eMMC chip being nothing special.
  - As workaround, try to use some newer card readers, or use a DSi console as
  - card reader (ie. write you software that can happily ignore CSD version).

## Mechanical problems

  - Most solder points are on the wrong PCB side (unlike as on DSi, you will
  - need to remove the 3DS mainboard). Whereas, the connector for the top screen
  - backlight is rated to survive max 10 mating cycles (mine died after 5-7).
  - Part of the problem was that I wasn't aware of the other problems mentioned
  - above (so I had removed the mainboard several times to check my soldering),
  - and, the connector is 'underneath' of the PCB, making it difficult to insert
  - the cable straight and smoothly, causing pins in the connector may get bent,
  - making it impossible to insert the ribbon cable (maybe it will help if you
  - take time, and don't impatiently try to push the cable into the socket).



## Soldering Notes


Connect CLK/CMD to the pins on right side of R113/R94 (as shown in the
drawing). Connect Data3/0/1/2 to the LOWER pins of RA4 (unlike as shown in the
drawing, ie. NOT to the upper pins), or alternately, connect them to the four
vias below of RA4. Connect GND somewhere to shielding plate, for example.

My own setup is: A 8pin ribbon cable soldered to a spare SD-to-SDmicro adapter
(used as connector for SD/MMC slots), the ribbon cable is wired to a small
circuit board, which is soldered to the shielding of the DSi's game cartridge
slot (just for mechanical stability). Next, some fragile wires are forwarded
from the circuit board to the actual mainboard pins.



## Software Notes


Remove the DSi wifiboard (not absolutely required, but doing so will hang the
DSi before accessing the eMMC, which ensures that the eMMC won't be accessed
simultaneously by the DSi and PC). Switch on the DSi. Connect it to SD/MMC card
reader. Under Windows, the eMMC should show up as MMC-storagedevice in Windows
Explorer (alongsides with your HDD drives), due to the encryption it isn't
possible to access the filesystem or logical partitions of the chip. However,
the physical sectors can be accessed.

For example, using HxD hex editor: Click Extras, Open Disk, and select the MMC
(in HxD it shows up under Physical Discs: as Removeable Disk). Click Edit,
Select All, Copy. Click File, New. Then Edit, Paste. And finally File, Save As
for saving an image of the whole 240MByte FLASH chip.

I've tried accessing the eMMC on two PCs, one worked, the other didn't:

```
  Win98 with External Card reader: Windows didn't recognize the MMC chip
  Win7  with External Card reader: Okay (recognized as "unformatted" disk)
  Win7  with Internal Card reader: Okay (recognized as "unformatted" disk)
```

For testing the Operating System/Card Reader side: Connect a normal SD card to
the card reader. If HxD is showing it as both Logical Disc and Physical Disc,
then you are fine. If it shows up as Logical Disc only, then your setup won't
work for accessing the eMMC chip.




# <a name="auxopeningthegba"></a>AUX Opening the GBA



Since Nintendo uses special screws with Y-shaped heads to seal the GBA (as well
as older 8bit gameboys), it's always a bit difficult to loosen these screws.



## Using Screwdrivers


One possible method is to use a small flat screwdriver, which might work, even
though it'll most likely damage the screwdriver.

Reportedly, special Y-shaped screwdrivers for gameboys are available for sale
somewhere (probably not at your local dealer, but you might find some in the
internet or elsewhere).



## Destroying the Screws


A more violent method is to take an electric drill, and drill-off the screw
heads, this might also slightly damage the GBA plastic chase, also take care
that the metal spoons from the destroyed screws don't produce shortcuts on the
GBA mainboard.



## Using a selfmade Screwdriver


A possible method is to take a larger screw (with a normal I-shaped, or
X-shaped head), and to cut the screw-tip into Y-shape, you'll then end up with
an "adapter" which can be placed in the middle between a normal screwdriver and
gameboy screws.

Preferably, first cut the screw-tip into a shape like a "sharp three sided
pyramid", next cut notches into each side. Access to a grinding-machine will be
a great benefit, but you might get it working by using a normal metal-file as
well.



## Opening the GBA Micro


- open the case with appropriate screwdriver or drilling machine or whatever

- remove the plastic front-plate (there are two snap-ins inside at ONE side)

- remove the mainboard and screen and plastic skeleton from the metal case

- remove the start/select daughter-board from the plastic skeleton

- remove the plastic skeleton (move the screen through the skeleton)

- remove the screen (lift lcd socket front-side, backlight socket rear-side)



## Opening the NDS-Lite


- open the case with appropriate screwdriver or drilling machine or whatever

- remove the RFU unit, and the 4-pin touch-screen cable (under the RFU unit)

- remove the mainboard together with the lower screen

- remove the upper/lower screen cables (on the rear-side of the mainboard)




# <a name="auxmainboard"></a>AUX Mainboard



Other possibly useful signals on the mainboard...



## FIQ Signal


The FIQ (Fast Interrupt) signal (labeled FIQ on the mainboard) could be used as
external interrupt (or debugging break) signal.

Caution: By default, the FIQ input is directly shortcut to VDD35 (+3V or +5V
power supply voltage), this can be healed by scratching off the CL1 connection
located close to the FIQ pin (FIQ still appears to have an internal pull-up, so
that an external resistor is not required).

The GBA BIOS rejects FIQs if using normal ROM cartridge headers (or when no
cartridge is inserted). When using a FIQ-compatible ROM header, Fast Interrupts
can be then requested by pulling FIQ to ground, either by a push button, or by
remote controlled signals.



## RESET Signal


The RESET signal (found on the mainboard) could be used to reset the GBA by
pulling the signal to ground for a few microseconds (or longer). The signal can
be directly used (it is not shortcut to VDD35, unlike FIQ).

Note: A reset always launches Nintendo's time-consuming and annoying boot/logo
procedure, so that it'd be recommend to avoid this "feature" when possible.



## Joypad Signals


The 10 direction/button signals are each directly shortcut to ground when
pressed, and pulled up high otherwise (unlike 8bit gameboys which used a 2x4
keyboard matrix), it'd be thus easy to connect a remote keyboard, keypad,
joypad, or read-only 12bit parallel port.

## DSi Wifi Daughterboard (J27H020) (alternate newer DSi version)


This seems to be functionally same as DWM-W024, but the PCB is different, and
the circuit seems to use a different voltage regulator, and includes solder
pads for some additional uninstalled components. And the shielding is difficult
to remove because it's soldered all way round (rather than just at some solder
points).

```
  1x bigger white/black connector  --> lift black lid (at cable-side)
```

Remove Battery board:

```
  1x smaller black connector       --> lift black lid (at cable-end) (!!!)
  1x bigger white/black connectors --> lift black lid (at cable-side)
  (don't disconnect bigger connector if the other cable end is already
  disconnected from mainboard) (or if you did do, reassemble as follows:
  longer cable end to battery board, short cable end to mainboard)
  1x battery cable (disconnect at mainboard side, see there)
```

Top Cover Disassembly:

```
  Disconnect upper LCD and mic/antenna from mainboard (see above)
  Remove 4 screws (all hidden under square rubber pieces)

The Fujitsu & NEC datasheets are specifing 14x10 grid (the chips are
essentially pin-compatible, except that: NEC has removed some NC pins, changed
some supply pins to NC, and (attempted to) rename VSS to GND).

However, the DSi mainboard has 12x8 grid solder pads (and the installed
NEC/Fujitsu chip/packages are actually only 12x8, too).

The DSi debug version is said to have 32Mbyte RAM, there is no provision for
that feature on DSi retail boards; dev boards are probably somewhere having an
extra address line (or an extra chip select for a 2nd RAM chip).

the "DAT4..DAT7" pins are not connected in DSi. The "VDDI" pin isn't wired to
VDD, instead it goes to a capacitor (0.1uF min) "for internal power stability".

Pin 152 seems to be not connected on the mainboard, maybe an undoc output.



## GBA-Micro, NDS, NDS-Lite, and DSi CPU Pinouts


Unknown. The CPU Pins are hidden underneath of the CPU. And, in NDS and
NDS-Lite, the CPU itself hides underneath of the DS Cartridge Slot. In the DSi
it's hidden underneath of a shielding plate (which is itself underneath of the
removeable wifi daughterboard).

This example shows a host sending beacons. The pre-beacon receive period is
probably to sense conflicts with other transmitters. The post-beacon receive
period is to get responses from other players. The two transmit parts are: The
hardware header, followed by inactivity on the tx pins during the rest of the
preamble period, then followed by the actual IEEE frame. The rest of the time
is spent in idle mode to reduce power consumption.

This example shows a client trying to receive beacons, so most of the time is
spent in receive mode (the short idle periods are probably occuring when it is
switching to another channel). Once when it has associated with a host, the
client may spend more time in idle mode, and needs to be in receive mode only
when expecting to receive beacons or other data.

# <a name="auxxboopctogbamultibootcable"></a>AUX Xboo PC-to-GBA Multiboot Cable



Below describes how to connect a PC parallel port to the GBA link port,
allowing to upload small programs (max 256 KBytes) from no$gba's Utility menu
into real GBAs.


This is possible because the GBA BIOS includes a built-in function for
downloading & executing program code even when no cartridge is inserted.
The program is loaded to 2000000h and up in GBA memory, and must contain
cartridge header information just as for normal ROM cartridges (nintendo logo,
checksum, etc., plus some additional multiboot info).



## Basic Cable Connection


The general connection is very simple (only needs four wires), the only problem
is that you need a special GBA plug or otherwise need to solder wires directly
to the GBA mainboard (see Examples below).

```
  GBA  Name  Color                 SUBD CNTR Name
  2    SO    Red     ------------- 10   10   /ACK
  3    SI    Orange  ------------- 14   14   /AUTOLF
  5    SC    Green   ------------- 1    1    /STROBE
  6    GND   Blue    ------------- 19   19   GND
```

Optionally, also connect the following signals (see notes below):

```
  4    SD    Brown   ------------- 17   36   /SELECT  (double speed burst)
  3    SI    Orange  ----[===]---- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up, 560 Ohm)
  5    SC    Green   ----[===]---- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up, 560 Ohm)
  4    SD    Brown   ----[===]---- 2..9 2..9 D0..7    (pull-up, 560 Ohm)
  START  (mainboard) -----|>|----- 16   31   /INIT    (auto-reset, 1N4148)
  SELECT (mainboard) -----|>|----- 16   31   /INIT    (auto-reset, 1N4148)
  RESET  (mainboard) -----||------ 16   31   /INIT    (auto-reset, 300nF)
```

Notes: The GBA Pins are arranged from left to right as 2,4,6 in upper row, and
1,3,5 in lower row; outside view of GBA socket; flat side of socket upside. The
above "Colors" are as used in most or all standard Nintendo link cables, note
that Red/Orange will be exchanged at one end in cables with crossed SO/SI
lines. At the PC side, use the SUBD pin numbers when connecting to a 25-pin
SUBD plug, or CNTR pin numbers for 36-pin Centronics plug.



## Optional SD Connection (Double Speed Burst)


The SD line is used for Double Speed Burst transfers only, in case that you are
using a gameboy link plug for the connection, and if that plug does not have a
SD-pin (such like from older 8bit gameboy cables), then you may leave out this
connection. Burst Boot will then only work half as fast though.



## Optional Pull-Ups (Improves Low-to-High Transition Speed)


If your parallel port works only with medium or slow delay settings, try to
connect 560 Ohm resistors to SI/SC/SD inputs each, and the other resistor pin
to any or all of the parallel port data lines (no$gba outputs high to pins
2..9).



## Optional Reset Connection (CAUTION: Connection changed September 2004)


The Reset connection allows to automatically reset & upload data even if a
program in the GBA has locked up (or if you've loaded a program that does not
support nocash burst boot), without having to reset the GBA manually by
switching it off and on (and without having to press Start+Select if a
cartridge is inserted).

The two diodes should be 1N4148 or similar, the capacitor should be 300nF (eg.
three 100nF capacitors in parallel). The signals are labeled on the mainboard,
and can be found at following names / CPU pin numbers: RESET/CPU.125,
SELECT/TP2/CPU.126, START/TP3/CPU.127.



## Optional Power Supply Connection


Also, you may want to connect the power supply to parallel port data lines, see
chapter Power Supply for details.



## Transmission Speed


The first transfer will be very slow, and the GBA BIOS will display the boot
logo for at least 4 seconds, even if the transfer has completed in less time.
Once when you have uploaded a program with burst boot backdoor, further
transfers will be ways faster. The table below shows transfer times for 0KByte
- 256KByte files:

```
  Boot Mode_____Delay 0_______Delay 1_______Delay 2_____
  Double Burst  0.1s - 1.8s   0.1s - 3.7s   0.1s - 5.3s
  Single Burst  0.1s - 3.6s   0.1s - 7.1s   0.1s - 10.6s
  Normal Bios   4.0s - 9.0s   4.0s - 12.7s  4.0s - 16.3s
```

All timings measured on a 66MHz computer, best possible transmission speed
should be 150KBytes/second. Timings might slightly vary depending on the CPU
speed and/or operating system. Synchronization is done by I/O waitstates, that
should work even on faster computers. Non-zero delays are eventually required
for cables without pull-ups.



## Requirements


Beside for the cable and plugs, no special requirements.

The cable should work with all parallel ports, including old-fashioned
one-directional printer ports, as well as modern bi-directional EPP ports.
Transfer timings should work stable regardless of the PCs CPU speed (see above
though), and regardless of multitasking interruptions.

Both no$gba and the actual transmission procedure are using some 32bit code, so
that either one currently requires 80386SX CPUs or above.



## Connection Examples


As far as I can imagine, there are four possible methods how to connect the
cable to the GBA. The first two methods don't require to open the GBA, and the
other methods also allow to connect optional power supply and reset signal.

```
  1) Connect it to the GBA link port. Advantage: No need to
     open/modify the GBA. Disadvantage: You need a special plug,
     (typically gained by removing it from a gameboy link cable).
  2) Solder the cable directly to the GBA link port pins. Advantages:
     No plug required & no need to open the GBA. Disadvantages:
     You can't remove the cable, and the link port becomes unusable.
  3) Solder the cable directly to the GBA mainboard. Advantage: No
     plug required at the GBA side. Disadvantage: You'll always
     have a cable leaping out of the GBA even when not using it,
     unless you put a small standard plug between GBA and cable.
  4) Install a Centronics socket in the GBA (between power switch
     and headphone socket). Advantage: You can use a standard
     printer cable. Disadvantages: You need to cut a big hole into
     the GBAs battery box (which cannot be used anymore), the big
     cable might be a bit uncomfortable when holding the GBA.
```

Personally, I've decided to use the lastmost method as I don't like ending up
with hundreds of special cables for different purposes, and asides, it's been
fun to damage the GAB as much as possible.



## Note


The above used PC parallel port signals are typically using 5V=HIGH while GBA
link ports deal with 3V=HIGH. From my experiences, the different voltages do
not cause communication problems (and do not damage the GBA and/or PC
hardware), and after all real men don't care about a handful of volts, however,
use at own risk.




# <a name="auxxbooflashcardupload"></a>AUX Xboo Flashcard Upload




## Flashcard Upload


Allows to write data to flashcards which are plugged into GBA cartridge slot,
cartridge is automatically started after writing. On initial power-up, hold
down START+SELECT to prevent the GBA from booting the old program in the
flashcard.

The Upload function in Utility menu uses flashcard mode for files bigger than
256KB (otherwise uses multiboot mode automatically). Also, there's a separate
Upload to Flashcard function in Remote Access submenu, allowing to write files
of 256KB or less to flashcard if that should be desired.



## Supported Flashcards


Function currently tested with Visoly Flash Advance (FA) 256Mbit (32MB) Turbo
cartridge. Should also work with older FA versions. Please let me know if you
are using other flashcards which aren't yet supported.



## Flashcard Performance


Writing to flashcards may become potentially slow because of chip erase/write
times, cable transmission time, and the sheer size of larger ROM-images.
However, developers whom are testing different builts of their project usually
won't need to rewrite the complete flashcard, Xboo uses a highspeed checksum
mechanism (16MB/sec) to determine which flashcard sector(s) have changed, and
does then re-write only these sector(s).

To eliminate transmission time, data transfer takes place in the erase phases.
Erase/write time depends on the flashcard type, should be circa 1-2 seconds per
256KB sector. Because the cartridge is programmed directly in the GBA there's
no need to remove it from the GBA when writing to it.



## Developers Advice


Locate your program fragments at fixed addresses, for example, code and data
blocks each aligned to 64K memory boundaries, so that data remains at the same
location even when the size of code changes. Fill any blank spaces by value FFh
for faster write time. Reduce the size of your ROM-image by efficient memory
use (except for above alignment trick). Include the burst boot backdoor in your
program, allowing to re-write the flashcard directly without resetting the GBA.



## Lamers Advice


Xboo Flashcard support does not mean to get lame & to drop normal multiboot
support, if your program fits into 256KB then make it \<both> flashcard
\<and> multiboot compatible - multiboot reduces upload time, increases
your flashcard lifetime, and will also work for people whom don't own
flashcards.




# <a name="auxxbooburstbootbackdoor"></a>AUX Xboo Burst Boot Backdoor



When writing Xboo compatible programs, always include a burst boot "backdoor",
this will allow yourself (and other people) to upload programs much faster as
when using the normal GBA BIOS multiboot function. Aside from the improved
transmission speed, there's no need to reset the GBA each time (eventually
manually if you do not have reset connect), without having to press
Start+Select (if cartridge inserted), and, most important, the time-consuming
nintendo-logo intro is bypassed.



## The Burst Boot Protocol


In your programs IRQ handler, add some code that watches out for burst boot IRQ
requests. When sensing a burst boot request, download the actual boot
procedure, and pass control to that procedure.

```
  Send (PC)    Reply (GBA)
  "BRST"       "BOOT"        ;request burst, and reply <prepared> for boot
  <wait 1/16s> <process IRQ> ;long delay, allow slave to enter IRQ handler
  llllllll     "OKAY"        ;send length in bytes, reply <ready> to boot
  dddddddd     --------      ;send data in 32bit units, reply don't care
  cccccccc     cccccccc      ;exchange crc (all data units added together)
```

Use normal mode, 32bit, external clock for all transfers. The received
highspeed loader (currently approx. 180h bytes) is to be loaded to and started
at 3000000h, which will then handle the actual download operation.


Below is an example program which works with multiboot, burstboot, and as
normal rom/flashcard. The source can be assembled with a22i (the no$gba
built-in assembler, see no$gba utility menu). When using other/mainstream
assemblers, you'll eventually have to change some directives, convert numbers
from NNNh into 0xNNN format, and define the origin somewhere in linker/makefile
instead of in source code.

## About


GBATEK written 2001-2014 by Martin Korth, programming specs for the GBA and NDS
hardware, I've been trying to keep the specs both as short as possible, and as
complete as possible. The document is part of the no$gba debuggers built-in
help text.



## Updates


The standalone docs in TXT and HTM format are updated when having added any
major changes to the document. The no$gba built-in version will be updated more
regularly, including for minor changes, along with all no$gba updates.
